It did not work with either. Keeps giving me 0 rows. I ran it again with only the column name as where name = 'WirelessNumber'; quit; and that had the correct output. I tried again with where libname = 'ac'; quit; and it returned 0. I am not sure why would that be happening, but thanks for your help. This was only a test run. I now have a db with over 1000 tables and multiple schemas. I assume that I would need the libname to work somehow to be able to make this work. Any further suggestions? 
No such luck. Order by doesn't seem to make a difference. The workaround is fairly simple; the easiest way is to change the column label to just "date," since this forces the result to print as a date (for some reason).
Double DOW-loop option: a bit more complex, but worth knowing about: data want(drop = x_sum); do until(eof1); set have end = eof1; x_sum + x; end; do until(eof2); set have end = eof2; y = x / x_sum; output; end; run;
are you looking for the word 'flow'? That breaks text which does not fit in its column.
Thanks man! I'll try that in the morning, I'll let you know if it works!
Just a head's up, I coded this under the assumption that you have no header information currently in your *.dat file. I hope this assumption was correct!
You are correct, there was no Header Data.
*(I am assuming that you are only referring to the header of each column for your report, and not the actual observations in your report.)* Here is some documentation around proc report. While I did not look for any character limits for variables, I did find an example where you can use a line break for the variable so the column is not so wide. Page #2, Step #3 http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/forum2008/079-2008.pdf
Hey, it's always good to know how to translate between languages!
I mean that's one way that should work, I would probably just write sum(x) =xsum just to be safe but yeah you're good 
Hey analytix! The code worked really well, thank you very much!
If you write them optimally, there can be a performance benefit vs. the equivalent proc, as there's a good chance that the proc will be using resources to produce additional output that you don't actually need. Here are the main use cases I've found for DOW-loops: * If you are working with arrays, there's a code saving, as you can avoid having to define your arrays multiple times across separate data steps. * Beats proc transpose hands down, especially when transposing multiple variables from long to wide format. * Import a list of identically formatted files in a single data step. * DOW-loops form the basis of [condensed indexes](http://analytics.ncsu.edu/sesug/2011/BB16.Keintz.pdf), which are stunningly useful in the right circumstances * Decent alternative to using retain statements with data step by-group processing. * Retrieving/updating rows in a non-unique indexed large file for a list of key values from a small file.
I'm sorry but I have to be honest here. 'Get the job done' is not an appropriate software development methodology. That's how you end up with slow, unmaintainable code.
I believe it is a bad example because it is hard to see that there are 2 spaces between each word. The state abbreviation is suppose to be preceded by 2 blanks as a delimiter. 
I believe this is the way it is suppose to be with spacing. The example is hard to count spacing. 
 DINA FIELDS 904 MAPLE CIRCLE DURHAM NC 27713 ELIZABETH GARRISON 1293 OAK AVENUE CHAPEL HILL NC 27614 DAVID HARRINGTON 2426 ELMWOOD LANE RALEIGH NC 27803
See the above example has only one space between "CHAPEL" and "HILL" where all the other words have 2 spaces. 
Oh! Okay that makes sense.. If there was only one space I was completely confused. Thanks so much! 
That's a really, really stupid problem for them to use in a certification test. Anyone who would ever create data anything like that in real life is extremely foolish, and you will probably never use the # and &amp; notations, either.
Yes I am using the remote submit, but I always using them when running the code as well as all tables are saved on unix server. I ran it like below and got the result surprising fast enough. Thank you very much. rsubmit; proc sql; create table work.columns as select libname, memname from dictionary.columns where name='WirelessNumber'; quit; endrsubmit; My next step is try to locate all schemas in db. Is that possible?
I am in almost similar boat as you, but I landed a job which is highly depending on SAS. I have prior sql and excel macros experience and it is helping greatly in this huge learning curve. Here are few links that can get you start. Good luck!! http://web.utk.edu/sas/OnlineTutor/1.2/en/60476/paths.htm http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join_inner.asp
`@@` is for reading multiple observations worth of data from the same line in your file. `@` is for when you need to use multiple input statements to process each line. These are both quite rare situations but they have their uses. `@` is useful when you need to use conditional logic to decide how to input certain variables and you don't want to repeat most of your input statement. `@@` can be quite useful for parsing json-formatted data that doesn't have any line breaks, for example.
Ah ok thanks!
The official definition is something like this: @ holds the line until the data step returns to the top whereas @@ holds the line even after the data step returns to the top.
I've had good luck with @ and json files, too; but never tried @@
It will likely depend on what kind of SQL and on what the DBA allows you to do in the database (if applicable). In the Teradata environment that I work in, I'd create a volatile table, which creates a temporary table in the database that's gone after the SAS session finishes. You can probably find something similar by Googling whatever database you're using along with "SAS temporary table" (without the quotes).
I am reading through the manual. Seems like this is what I was looking for. Still not sure how to generalize the [binary multivariate example most resembling my situation](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63962/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_genmod_sect065.htm), to the case of multinomial response variables. 
If your date format ALWAYS has the day name as the first word then perhaps something like either: monyy1 = STRIP(SCAN(monyy,2) || SCAN(monyy,3) || SCAN(monyy,4)); monyy1 = COMPRESS(SUBSTR(monyy, INDEX(monyy," ")));
thanks! yes, it always has the day name. I did something like that and it worked. monyy = 'Saturday 12 February 2011'; monyy2 = CAT(scan(monyy,2,', '),SUBSTR(scan(monyy,3,', '),1,3),scan(monyy,4,', '));
Nice. You don't need to specify the *scan* separator list as the default is a space which will suit your purposes just fine. Ah, substr the month, of course, well done! monyy2 = CAT(scan(monyy,2), SUBSTR(scan(monyy,3),1,3), scan(monyy,4));
I'm trying to think of other solutions. PROC CATMOD might be another option. It allows for logistic regression, and you can specify RESPONSE LOGITS to specify that the response functions are cumulative logits. With multinominal, though, I'm kind of revisiting PROC LOGISTIC. Have you tried using the STRATA statement? I don't think this allows for SCORE, though, so that might be a non-starter. I don't suppose your company has Visual Statistics, huh. That would make it a whole lot easier.
No we don't have Visual Statistics :( Only SAS Base and SAS/STAT. Thanks will be reading on CATMOD. I could get PROC GENMOD with binary reposnse work, which I a progress. I should say at this point being able to use the SCORE statemnt is only a nice to have. As foremost I like to be able to fit the model.
http://www.stat.lsu.edu/faculty/geaghan/pdmix800.sas.txt Saxton's macro Read the link with the code, should explain everything for you
Have you sent a ticket to SAS to see if they can suggest anything? Depending on your company and your license, there could be a solutions architect, or at least certainly available to you. Just need a SAS.com profile, which is free.
Possibly: PROC SQL; CREATE Day6 AS SELECT T1.ID, T1.drug1date, T2.drug2date FROM tbl AS T1 LEFT JOIN tbl AS T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE (T1.drug1date ne .) AND (T2.drug2date ne.) AND ABS(T1.drug1date - T2.drug2date) le 6; QUIT;
Good suggestion. Hadn't thought about that. I will see if it works. 
Thanks! I think I need to tweak a little to capture some little nuances I didn't explain, but this is working. 
There is no way to dynamically set or alter the size of an array during data step execution, so don't waste your time trying. If you want an array that's exactly the right size, you will need to make 2 passes through your data - one to find the maximum, then a second to use that maximum to create your array. There are lots of ways of doing this. Alternatively, you can create a fixed size array that covers most cases most of the time and discard any excess activities.
Have you tried connecting to http://localhost:10080 ?
You can count the ',' using the index function +1 and assign the value to a macro variable. Use that macro variable when declaring ... array activity [*] activity1-activity&amp;i. You could also use macro code Proc sql; Select max (index (activities,',')) into:tot from have; Quit; Data want; Set have; %do i=1 %to &amp;tot. ; Activity&amp;i.= scan (activities, &amp;i., 1); %end; Run;
Can you give an example of the output?
I got something like this. data reddit1 (drop=i new1-new20); set reddit; array nonmiss{20} v1-v20; array new{20} $; input new{*}; do i=1 to 20; if nonmiss{i}=. then new{i}=' '; end; notmiss=catx(' ',of new1-new20); datalines; v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6 v7 v8 v9 v10 v11 v12 v13 v14 v15 v16 v17 v18 v19 v20 ; run; Not sure if there's an easier way, and this is assuming all your v1-v20 are numbers. But i'm a noob.
V1-V20 have either numeric values or are missing.
I like the training modules provided by SAS. These are the free ones: http://support.sas.com/training/tutorial/ And there's always white papers...
Example dataset: data have; array v{20}; do i = 1 to 100; do j = 1 to 20; if ranuni(1) &lt; 0.15 then call missing(v[j]); else v[j] = 1; end; output; end; drop i j; run; Solution: data want; length missingvars $100; set have; array v{*} v:; do i = 1 to dim(v); if missing(v[i]) then call catx(' ',missingvars,vname(v[i])); end; drop i; run;
This would give you the contents of the variables in question rather than the names of the ones with missing values.
as /u/kzig said there's no way to do this on the first and only pass, however you could easily make 2 passes to do this data test set have; retain maxactivity; if _N_=1 then do; maxactivity = count(activities, ','); end; else if (maxactivity &lt; count(activities, ',')) then do maxactivities = count(activities, ','); call symput("ActivitiesCount",maxactivities); end; run; or I'm sure there's a faster proc SQL way to do this with max count of commas. 
The performance should be similar, but with proc sql you don't have to write quite as much code: proc sql noprint; select max(count(name,'a')) + 1 into :a_max from sashelp.class; quit; Don't forget to add 1 to the number of commas!
Remove the first.user? That should get you the first attempt for each user and module data test; infile datalines delimiter=','; input User $ Module $ Completion_Date anydtdte.; datalines; Ron,A,AUG 1 Ron,A,AUG 2 Ron,B,AUG 2 Ron,B,AUG 3 Ron,C,JUL 1 Joy,A,JUL 1 Joy,B,JUL 2 Joy,C,JUL 3 Susan,A,AUG 1 run; PROC SORT data=test; by User Module Completion_Date; run; data report; set test; By User Module Completion_Date; if first.module; run; proc print data=report; format Completion_Date date9. run; 
good catch, I would have forgotten the addition of 1 :)
Ah, kind madam or sir! I actually just came to this solution not more than a minute before refreshing and seeing your response (Of course I mulled over it for the better part of my afternoon). You have the correct answer! Do you think there's a hidden way to do this inside of a PROC SORT statement alone? Nothing that I've found. 
Works like a charm. Thanks! Ps: just had to add =0 after missing as I needed the non-missing ones. 
Two different ways I can think of: 1. If the data is not sorted: proc sql; create table temp as select distinct women_id, man_id from marriage_table; quit; data temp; set temp; marriage\_id = \_n\_; run; proc sql; create table marriage_table_with ID as select a.year,a.women_id,a.man_id,b.marriage_id from marriage_table a, temp b where a.women_id = b.women_id and a.temp = b.temp; quit; 2. if data is sorted by women_id and man_id, or you can use a proc sort to sort the data on those variables: data marriage_table; set marriage_table; by women_id man_id; if first.women_id and first.man_id then marriage_id + 1; run; 
Yeah okay, i think i can use the second method. thanks a bunch ! Edit: And it worked, thanks again :) 
Just FYI, you can lump both first.x commands together by just using first.man_id -- since the by is "by woman_id man_id" the woman_id is implicit. It's almost like writing "if first.(woman_id man_id combo) then ..."
That's true, thanks! 
An easy, one-step query would look something like this, I think: proc sql; create table marriage_with_ID as select a.year, a.woman_id, a.man_id, b.marriage_id from marriage_id a left join ( select distinct woman_id, man_id, monotonic() as marriage_id from marriage) b on a.woman_id=b.woman_id and a.man_id=b.man_id; quit; I see that you already got an answer; this is more of a thought experiment, honestly.
Where catx (' ', of v1-v20 ) contains 'WORD';
My current method is requiring me to have a long line of or statements in a proc sql statement. Thus, it looks like: where upper(varx) contains 'WORD X' or upper(vary) contains 'Word X' 
True, same argument holds true for any separator. I can't decide the separator without looking at the data, so I provided the most generic one I could think of. 
Poo, was hoping to automate this all in SAS. Thanks.
I'd suggest using macro coding. Use proc transpose, by page and day in the id statement prefix=D. Transposed data set should have variables page D1 D2 D3 D4. Data analysis; Set transposed; %let i=1; %let j=%eval (&amp;i.+1);* if i=1 then j=2; %let k=%eval (&amp;i.+2);* if i=1 then k=3; %let l=%eval (&amp;i.+3);* if i=1 then l=3; If D&amp;i.&gt;0 &amp; D&amp;j.=0 &amp; D&amp;k.&gt;0 then avg_&amp;i._&amp;k.=mean (D&amp;i. , D&amp;j.); If D&amp;i.&gt;0 &amp; D&amp;j.=0 &amp; D&amp;k.=0 &amp; D&amp;l.&gt;0 then avg_&amp;i._&amp;l.=mean (D&amp;i. , D&amp;l.); Run; Merge analysis dataset by page back to original dataset and use %do ....; %end; to do the comparison and select the variable to get the mean value from. Use drop D: AVG: ; in the end, to drop all of the variables created in analysis dataset. 
Here's a low tech approach to the same problem. If the dataset is not too big, you can add a couple of variables to the dataset temporarily with the non-zero counts before and after the particular observation. Then you calculate the interpolation and drop the extra variables in the last step. This logic needs the data to be sorted by Page and Date as you have shown. You can sort the data again at the end if you need it in the same order as you started with. data Page_Counts; set Page_Counts; by Page; retain before_count; if first.page then before_count = 0; if Count NE 0 then before_count = Count; run; proc sort data=Page_Counts; by descending Page Descending Date; quit; data Page_Counts(drop=before_count after_count); set Page_Counts; by Descending Page; retain after_count; if first.page then after_count = 0; if Count NE 0 then after_count = Count; else if Count = 0 and (before_count+after_count)&gt;= 100 then Count = (before_count+after_count)/2; run; Edit: shortened by one step
Here's a semi-hack way of doing it, using the BCP utility - used for loading/unloading data in SQL Server. You can pass an SQL query in the command, so if your source data is easily filtered, or ready to go, just drop it into the macro variable. If you'd rather prepare it first, use the SQLCMD utility and an SQL file first - you can use the same filename logic below to dynamically build your SQL file too, then just put two lines in the BAT file (SQLCMD followed by BCP). Any questions, just ask mate.

Try $ after the date variables, since you've assigned $10 to them. 
SAS Studio is great if you want to plan projects. If you want to start a project by using programs from 3 different projects, you can do it easily here. For remote access SAS, at work I've SAS on server and everyone gets SEG on their desktop. So no need for license for individual users. Save the files on the server, and you can access your remote desktop from anywhere or any computer. 
forget the length instead use data cholesterol; infile "/folders/myfolders/sasuser.v94/Question2.csv" dlm=',' dsd missover firstobs=2; informat hba1cdt tcholdt mmddyy10.; input sex $ hba1c hba1cdt tchot tcholdt trig hdl ldl id birthyr; format hba1cdt tcholdt ddmmyy10.; run; This might be wrong.. but try it anyway.
I tried it but they are already defined as string variables so it dosent change
This should work. The date variable is being read in as numeric date. You can convert it character using put (var,ddmmyy10.)
We seem to be getting somewhere with this. Do you mean like this: data cholesterol; infile "/folders/myfolders/sasuser.v94/Question2.csv" dlm=',' dsd missover firstobs=2; Dtn=input (hba1cdt tcholdt, ddmmyy10.) input sex $ hba1c hba1cdt tchot tcholdt trig hdl ldl id birthyr; 
actually no that dosent work
Infile ..... ; Input ... hba1cdt $ .... tcholdt $ ....; Hba1cdtn=input (hba1cdtn,ddmmyy10.); Tcholdtn=input (tcholdt,ddmmyy10.); Format hba1cdtn Tcholdtn ddmmyy10.;
pm'd
Actually you forgot the : after the variable to indicate the informat so it should be like input sex $ hba1c hba1cdt : ddmmyy10. tchot tcholdt : ddmmyy10. trig hdl ldl id birthyr; I included the format for the two variables as well so that he could read it when its printed or whatever..
thanks so much mjgsimple! problem is resolved now
So I am doing that but I am still having trouble understanding how it would work if I had Base installed on my computer. Let's say I have base installed on a desktop in my office, could I log into Studio from another computer and basically run code from there and be able to get the results on the desktop?
Theoretically it should work. But I'm not sure if SAS on server and Base SAS on computer are the same. Good luck! 
Thank you! I think you nailed it! I completely forgot that ** is the syntax for exponents. So as you wrote it in the gfr equation SAS will take the minimum of scr/kappa and 1 and maximum of scr/kappa and 1?
You could also do this with the data step Data Test; data test; set source; by id; retain copydrug1; if drug1 ne . then Copydrug1=drug1; if drug2 ne . then do ; if drug2-Copydrug1 &lt; 6 then flag="T"; end; run; 
The problem with SAS University edition is that it runs in a virtual machine and it can be difficult to get it to talk to your host computer.
I never tried that. But it is possible to run it on the Amazon cloud, so it might be possible. You are still restricted to two cores though. And when run locally, it is a bit of a memory hog (taking 1 Gig).
Oh hey I just saw this. SAS Studio is an environment that runs in any web browser, so you can interact with SAS whenever and wherever you want. No install is required, so you could have as many laptops/desktops as you want in your inventory and each one would be able to access SAS. It is an interface that comes with every product, so long as you have Base SAS. So with any computer, you can just fire up your web browser, navigate to SAS Studio, and start your programming. Processing happens in the SAS server, which would either be in a cloud server or in your local environment, depending on the license you've got. Once the code is processed, the results are returned to SAS studio. If this is a Single-User environment with Base SAS running on Windows or with SAS University, you access SAS studio through your web browser on the same machine SAS is installed. If you allow for Multi-User environment where SAS is installed on a server, you can access SAS Studio on ANY machine by pointing to the server where SAS is running. You'd just need to verify your credentials. Ditto with an Enterprise environment. As far as your specific question about slaving out work to your desktop from another computer, you'd either need a copy of SAS on the desktop (which you would remote connect to from any computer) or else you'd need to have SAS on a server.
Happy to help! Let me know if you've got any more specific questions
Ok. However, if I did not use the first.var or the last.var, it would have no impact on the dataset? Also, if I had two variables in the buy statements, and then used the first command, it would have the first value for each by group?
Right, and it looks like /u/boothy4trks already went through this, but the BY stuff would more come into play when you are merging multiple datasets. Your results won't be changed at all with the datastep creation options in your example. [example of how SAS determines FIRST and LAST with multiple variables](https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrcon/62955/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a000761931.htm) 
An index on the `by` variables also works if the dataset isn't sorted. You also have the option to specify `descending` or `notsorted` if you just want to work in reverse or process success runs of the same value without the dataset being sorted.
Yea I use the by step for merges every time. I just couldn't figure out why some code I inherited had it in a non-merge data step. It turned out they were deleting the first observation of each by group.
Formatting! Two spaces at the end of a line will stop wrapping. There is also a way to [make tables](https://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/wiki/table-format) but it isn't simple. Sounds like you are trying to create a compound variable which will have non-exclusive values. i.e. someone who takes math science french gets both 2 and 1. Anyway - you want a single record per ID, so you are going to have to aggregate fields by ID. Once that is done then your logic should be straight forward. DATA test; INPUT ID Subject $; Yup = 1; * Created for transpose - could have used Subject as VAR; DATALINES; 1 Maths 1 English 1 French 2 Maths 2 Science 2 PhysEd 3 Maths 3 Science 3 French 4 Maths 4 Science 4 English ; RUN; *** [1] USING BY/RETAIN/OUTPUT; PROC SORT DATA=test; BY ID; RUN; DATA test02; SET test; BY ID; RETAIN Maths Science French PhysEd English 0; IF FIRST.ID THEN DO; Maths = 0; Science = 0; French = 0; PhysEd = 0; English = 0; END; IF Subject = "Maths" THEN Maths = 1; IF Subject = "Science" THEN Science = 1; IF Subject = "French" THEN French = 1; IF Subject = "PhysEd" THEN PhysEd = 1; IF Subject = "English" THEN English = 1; IF LAST.ID THEN OUTPUT; RUN; *** [2] USING TRANSPOSE; PROC SORT DATA=test; BY ID; RUN; PROC TRANSPOSE DATA=test OUT=test03 (DROP=_NAME_); BY ID; ID Subject; VAR Yup; RUN;

Many thanks to both of you. Is there a way to loop over the tables to save me typing in the conditions. Adopting your code, pm_me_anything_funny, %array(x, maths science french) %array(y, maths science french) Proc sql ; Create table %x_%y as Select as n ( distinct (id)) as cnt1 From transposed (where=(%x=1 &amp; %y =1)); or something to that end. What I essentially would like to do is to loop over all combinations. Many thanks once again
I made a change to my code before I saw your comment. I'd suggest replying to my comment so I get it in my inbox. 
The only other side effect of the BY statement that I can think of is that SAS will then "know" that example1 is sorted by var1 and var2. So that sort would show up in Proc Contents. Otherwise, there isn't much impact because SAS knows it's sorted.
What an awesome reply.
Thank you. Where's my upvote ;-p
Thank you!! You're a generous angel :-)
Thanks for your help.
Second DATA step's BY clause should use Child2_ID. People who have child1 and child2 will have child2 overwrite child1 values ... or do you rename every variable in age_set so they don't clash with the first merge? Further, the second merge has "if a" which will exclude people with only one child.
that was a typo, i do merge by child2_ID. And i see your point with the 'if a', but how do i get aroudn that? So i only merge the age to the children i have in the married set. When i dont include the 'if a' i merge the whole second agedataset to the first marriedset, but i dont want that. I only want to merge the childrens age to the children i have in the first set. I hope i dont write to confusing :/
Have you tried ultraedit. I worked in a place where batch submit was already setup in ultraedit for me. 
SAS is installed on the server, not my local computer. So I ssh into the server to submit SAS code. I'm given an Emacs solution but it is not very clean and most of my coworkers do not use it.
Emacs with ESS is essentially the solution provided to us, but I do not like it. Though if I have some bigger projects coming up I'll probably force myself to use it. It's just so much different from other editors and environments I've used before. And if I switched to a shell to submit, it'd essentially be the same as what I'm currently doing. I've only worked a little with SAS for about a year so I wasn't sure if I was chasing rainbows or not. It was worth an ask though!
You could write a wrapper script that submits the code using SSH and captures the input. I know in Python, something like Fabric would solve this. There are probably other solutions I don't know about. Once you have the wrapper script, it could be called from Notepad++.
Thansk for the time, ill try it out! :)
Gotcha - I'm just really confused why they don't provide a native solution. Like, we have SAS installed on a server, but either remote into it or use Enterprise Guide to submit jobs. The server does all of the processing, but we have an interface on the local machine. I just don't get why, if you need to use SAS as a part of your job, they are failing to equip you properly. Seems like your organization needs to get their shit together.
Give it a shot? What's the downside of trying?
The `set` statement is for reading data from sas datasets, which usually have the file extension .sas7bdat. If you want to execute a sas program (usually .sas extension) you should use a `%include` statement.
Can you please give me an example of how to use %include?
Or, how would you read a .sas file? Infile doesnt work either lol.
You should have just started using University edition like we said. Make sure parallels has the permission to access the desktop, or make sure there hasn't been a hidden folder made. 
Not sure SAS University Edition has a small footprint. I think it is about 1 GB.
learn by doing. Try to grab some Census data and do some aggregations. SAS is a broad platform, tutorials are not likely to tell you what's relevant to your job in the order you need it. Videos have low information density (and often yes, cringe-inducing soundtracks). I was in a similar situation 10 years ago, worried about not knowing how to code in SAS for job; it may seem overwhelming at first but it will become familiar as you learn to apply it to what you need to do. trust that it isn't that hard even if it seems weird at first. data step and proc sql will be your friends. I would start with those. The Little SAS Book is good, too.
I am honestly surprised I haven't seen [this resource](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/sas/sk/default.htm) mentioned yet. When you click "Class notes with movies" you can follow along with the exercises and get a real feel for the program and the language. The learning modules are also useful for further analysis examples.
First: read the Base SAS certification prep guide. It'll teach you the basics and the inner workings of SAS. Many people skip this and take forever when debugging their code. Because they don't undrstand how PDV works and end up with bad codes. Second: go over the sas papers or posters pertaining to your industry. It'll provide you with options and reasons why the code was selected. So you can start practicing what's needed for your field. Third: maintain a repository of good clean code. So you don't have to remember the syntax, copy-paste is your best friend. Also you can wrap this code in macro and make life easy. Learn to write clean code with documentation. It'll be easy for you to maintain and understand when you come back to it later. Fourth: learn data step, merge , proc transpose, proc univariate and proc freq. Proc sql if you already are familiar use it to check your data step results. Finally: learn MACROS. This'll make your life very very easy. Many programmers waste time ,resource and produce high maintenance code. 
Seconded for Little SAS Book. It sits next to my SQL For Dummies and I pull both of them off the shelf a couple times a week, and I've been using SAS daily for 8 years and SQL for almost 20... There is an enormous wealth of documentation available on SAS's website. This is the doc for the most-used parts of base SAS: http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/proc/67916/HTML/default/viewer.htm#titlepage.htm Notice there's a PDF link at the top - you can download and peruse on your own computer. They have online doc for everything. Proc Stat, Proc SQL, ODS graphics, you name it, there's documentation there, and most of it is downloadable. Not that the doc is particularly helpful off the bat, but it helps as you learn. Also, proceedings from their annual Global Forum are online: http://support.sas.com/events/sasglobalforum/previous/online.html There you can find super-in-depth papers on how to conduct a particular analysis, and also beginners tips and "coder's corner" papers. 
I think that'd need to be &amp;&amp;ban&amp;ana, but yeah I agree that this is the easiest solution.
I thought 65,534 characters is the maximum length allowed for macros. What version of SAS are you on? What does your error message say?
It sounds like he is putting all of the text in the %include statement itself instead of in the file referenced by the %include. I don't believe there is a limit to the amount of text that you can %include.
 * Submitting SAS code using a %INCLUDE statement imposes a maximum length limit of 2,000 characters prior to SAS 9.1. For SAS 9.1 and beyond the maximum length limit is 6,000 characters. For further information on %INCLUDE see SAS Notes: #004448, #008328, and #039619. 15883 - Length limitations when submitting SAS code http://support.sas.com/kb/15/883.html
Split your %include into smaller subroutines. It should work by including them %inc part1; %inc part2;.... ;%inc partn;
Ah shoot I forgot what we were doing. I've brought shame upon my family 
 %include "c:\myfiles\mySASsource" / lrecl=50000;
Sorry to hear that! Ask again in the Spring to attend SAS Global Forum at The Venetian in Las Vegas. The web site usually includes a downloadable PDF that you can share with your manager on the benefits you and your employer would get if you attended. Would he/she have any reason to go too?
Thanks for posting the answer. That will be helpful one day to someone. 
*EDIT - And it worked like a charm, thansk a lot ! :D Yeah want to extract the 'year' part. I have the date of birth as DDMMYY10, so fx 21/03/1980. So for the year 1995, the person turns 15, so i just want to extract 1980 from 1995=15. So with your code, woudl it works if i put it like: Age2=myYearVar - YEAR(myDOB); Sas would know that i want to 'read' the year part, by adding YEAR in front on the dob var ? Thanks for the answer :)
Sas beginner (maybe a little more than beginner, but still new), can you ELI5 your post? 
Yeah, serious pet peeve.
Currently on SAS 9.2. Error message is "WARNING: Truncated record."
Have you tried splitting %inc to several sub parts? 
I think you can just subtract the year. YDifference=Year-year(dob) Year() will extract the year from a date. But you have to make sure the dob is being interpreted as a numeric variable. 
No, if I have to go that route I would just embed the query in the SAS code itself. But, good idea for possible usage in the future.
So how about having the code in an external file and then including the file? 
Can you provide what your text file looks? Is it SAS code or is it *.txt something like a paragraph from a book. 
do you have line breaks?
You can read the same line multiple times in the same data step with separate input statements. e.g. data yourdata1 yourdata2; input /*Insert input logic #1 here*/ @; output yourdata1; input /*Insert input logic #2 here*/; output yourdata2; datalines; /*Insert raw data here*/ ; run; The key bit is the single trailing `@` at the end of the first input statement, which tells SAS to hold the line for further input statements in the same iteration of the data step.
Here are a couple of examples: %let WHERE_CONDITION = SEX in ('F','?'); proc sql; title "Where clause in select statement"; select * from sashelp.class where &amp;WHERE_CONDITION ; title "Where clause as data set option"; select * from sashelp.class(where = (&amp;WHERE_CONDITION)) ; quit;
In a .SAS? Guess I have to ask why? Line breaks mate, put some into your query!
I like the way you posted basically the same response to each person in the thread, but tweaked the %unquote parameter to match their code :) Glad you got it sorted. It sounds odd that you'd need unquote to make it work - if you want to share your code it might be possible to refine it, but if you're happy then no worries! 
Unless you have used one of the macro quoting functions (e.g. `%nrstr`) when generating your macro variable, there should be no need to resort to `%unquote`. The code I posted works verbatim in SAS 9.4.
I'm learning all this as I go, and I can't stand when I try to trace things that don't seem to be traceable. Also, I've found that some people just read the reply, and not the rest of the thread, so I like to make sure it makes sense to them as well. I found that the problem was that the Macro was being converted (without my knowledge) because it was being passed from a Prompt in a Stored Process. Thanks again for your help, it's really nice to have people like you helping out!
For study at home you can download and use SAS University Edition for free I believe. A quick Google should direct you to it. The install is a bit convoluted as it needs a virtual box, but documentation is provided and it's free as well.
Possibly both? I think it may mostly be predictive since that'd be more useful in determining future risk of insurance policies. Although i can imagine deterministic research would also be useful. Where can you take these courses? Also, would it be beneficial to learn SQL? Can the SQL language be implemented in SAS?
Yes i noticed their tutorials when visiting the website
; quit;
If you don't mind them seeing the other recipients then just load them to a macro variable and delimit with a semicolon. 
Perfect, thank you. I need everyone to see whoever else is there, so that's great. Thank you, I will start researching.
Have you tried posting that question in SAS Communities? There are featured posts around what you are asking. Here is the link: https://communities.sas.com/?referer=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunities.sas.com%2Ft5%2Fcommunity%2Fpage.searchformv1.searchform.form.form 
Dude that's awesome. I've taken like four courses already using SAS and I didn't even know this. I'm not OP but its great to see new methods like this.
I don't think this is possible, unless you've saved a change to a separate file that you want to `%include` in its entirety, or you run your whole program again. The closest option I can think of would be to set `option spool;` before running your code the first time, then after you've checked the log and identified the problematic line numbers, you can them re-run just those lines by submitting `%inc 5-10;`, but it's probably easier just to select the section you want to re-run.
I wanted to add that there are also ways to do this with a JOIN in proc sql but i felt the above was easier to look at in case you haven't worked with SQL before.
Data final; Merge one (in=a) two (in=b rename=(pt=byvar)); By byvar; If a ; Run;
Small scale runs are a good way to get a reasonable idea of what to expect. There are a couple of other things you can do: * Check how much CPU time your SAS process uses for a small run, then scale up accordingly for a larger run. CPU time reported in the SAS log is consistent with CPU time reported by task manager / prstat / top. If you monitor the process while it's running, you can build up a rough estimate of how far it's got to go. Although the amount of real time taken is highly variable, especially on shared systems, the amount of CPU time required to run the same bit of code should never change very much. * If you are running a data step, and you know how many obs there are in the source, you can include a put statement that will print a line to the log e.g. after every 1% of the obs have been processed - e.g. something like the following code. N.B. For this to be at all useful, you will need to make sure that the log is being output either directly to the log window in your current session, or to a file that you can read outside SAS, e.g. by setting it via `proc printto`. The latter is necessary if you are remote submitting code. data output_dataset; set input_dataset nobs = nobs; if obs_1pct = 0 then obs_1pct + ceil(nobs/100); if mod(_n_, obs_1pct) = obs_1pct - 1 then do; pct_done = _n_ / nobs; putlog "The current data step is" pct_done percent. "done"; end; run; 
That is pretty cool. I'm going to start using this!
thanks so much u/Yukaka just added it in. Good idea about the error bars. Have a good day
This has probably been done before, but I thought I'd have a go at macro-ising the code I posted earlier and adding a basic completion time estimate: %macro progress(nobs=nobs,_n_=_n_); length __msg1 __msg2 $ 100; if __obs_1pct = 0 then __obs_1pct + ceil(&amp;nobs/100); if mod(&amp;_n_, __obs_1pct) = __obs_1pct - 1 then do; __pct_done = &amp;_n_ / &amp;nobs; __time = time(); __msg1 = cat("The current data step is",put(__pct_done,percent.),"done."); __msg2 = ''; putlog ; if not missing(__prev_time) then do; __timeleft = (__time - __prev_time)*(1 - __pct_done)/(__pct_done - __prev_pct_done); __msg2 = cat(" Estimated time remaining:",put(__timeleft,time12.3)); end; putlog __msg1 __msg2; end; retain __prev_pct_done __prev_time; __prev_pct_done = __pct_done; __prev_time = __time; drop __msg1 __msg2 __obs_1pct __time __pct_done __prev_time __prev_pct_done __timeleft; %mend; data output_dataset; set sashelp.class nobs = nobs; call sleep(1,0.1); %progress; run; The main annoying thing about it is the 100 lines of log output every time it runs. There are various ways of mitigating this - e.g. making an initial estimate based on the first 1% of obs, and then printing subsequent messages at a reduced frequency, or limiting it to 1 log message every x minutes. This should be a good start, though.
Would you be willing to explain the code line by line? I feel like this could be amazingly helpful and I have worked with macros but I am having difficulty following what's going on. I started using SAS 3 months ago.. Wish I was that advanced. 
You are saying this will output to the log as a msg?
Each part of the statement needs to be able to be evaluated. IF FIRST.B = 5 AND C=5 ... The way that you have written it will be interpreted as 'if first.b is TRUE'. 
I don't know if this would affect results, but in this case it seems that the by statement one needs to include b, possibly a. Also, is the data set properly sorted? 
Duh, sorry, I'd forgotten that. 
Possibly start with something like: PROC SQL; CREATE TABLE NameStreet AS SELECT Name, Street, Count(*) AS Freq FROM myData GROUP BY Name, Street; QUIT; You will likely need to join street name with suburb, postcode (zip). You're going to run into problems with: (1) unrelated streets of the same name in different suburbs (2) streets that extend across different suburbs
I would suggest this to check your data first. If first.b then bflag=1; If c=5 then cflag=1; If d in (3,4) then dflag=1; 
Option 1: Proc sql noprint; Create table as option1 select as id, mean (z) as option1 from data_in (where=(condition_row1 or condition_row2)) Group by id; Quit; Option 2: Proc transpose data =data_in (where=(condition_row1 or condition_row2 )) out=datain_transposed prefix=z; By id; Var z; Run; Data options2; Set datain_transposed; Z=means (z1, z2); Run; Option 3: Proc means data= data_in (where=(condition_row1 or condition_row2 )) out=options3; By id; Var z; Run;
OP has not indicated that there are multiple datasets, so I don't see how a left join is useful in this scenario.
If the records are successive within the dataset, you could use the lag function: Lag_line = lag(line) Lag_subline = lag(subline) Lag_value = lag(value) If line=lag_subline and value is missing then value=lag_value. I didn't compare sublines in my example because they have different values in your sample data, but you may want to check those variables too. If this isn't what you mean then could you possibly post a little more information?
I can't believe he was SAS the whole time. 
There are a few ways to do this. I would put the outliers in a separate data set. Data calcdata outliers; Set data; If data1 &lt;x or data1 &gt;x then output outliers; Else output calcdata; Run; Or if you want them in the same data set, instead of writing "then output outliers", write: Then do; Newvar = data1; Data1 = .; End; 
Thank you for the reply, but my problem is not with moving columns from data set to data set, but with adding a new column of calculation of standard deviation Can you help me acheive something like this?
You'll have to process the data twice. The first time, you would determine the STD with proc summary or whatever proc you want. There are several ways to do it from there. You could merge the original data set with the proc summary output data and do the comparison. Or you could assign the STD to a macro variable and compare to that on the second pass. Those are just a couple of the many ways you could do it.
Oh and how is this different from SAS telling you in the LOG through warnings, errors, and notes?
Well, it's not different from the log. This is the internal variable that the log uses to make the report. The statement doesn't really need to be used explicitly, but you might see it referenced on large batches where the programmer wants to control how things are handled when an error is present. Resetting to 0 is just a clean practice if you've been screwing around with the Program Data Vector and you need it to reset at different intervals than the default. I know it's printed by some auto-code procedures, but I wouldn't use it unless I was controlling data based on errors or if a previous script may have altered the setting. The auto-code is only doing this because it doesn't know what was running in your environment before its' script. Final example: You've got 20 scripts that all run on a daily schedule. Each script is 50,000 lines. They're run in batch mode. If \_EFIERR_ = 1 on any of these scripts, maybe you've written a statement that will write a note in the log about which step, or maybe you've arranged SAS to email you the log when \_EFIERR_ = 1. SAS creates a lot of hidden variables that aren't always necessary to know about, but can be useful hacks. 
I appreciate the help, but could I ask for some help with the syntax as well? My main problem right now is understanding how to write the proc summary block in a way that I can use it's results within the proc univariate analysis. This is the code I'm running right now - FILENAME REFFILE "/folders/myfolders/subji.xlsx" TERMSTR=CR; PROC IMPORT DATAFILE=REFFILE DBMS=XLSX OUT=ds; GETNAMES=YES; RUN; PROC SORT DATA=ds; BY subject Color_Compatibility sameloc; RUN; PROC UNIVARIATE DATA=ds NOPRINT; VAR resprt; OUTPUT OUT=unids1 MEAN=resprt; BY subject Color_Compatibility sameloc; where Color_Compatibility &gt;0 and practice = 0 and outlier = 0 and respAC=1; RUN; PROC MEANS DATA=unids1 MEAN MAXDEC=2 stddev; VAR resprt; class Color_Compatibility sameloc; RUN; I want to insert a proc summary that will replace the line saying "outlier = 0" in proc univariate (right now outlier is an excel generated column, which doesn't give me the results I'm expecting) EDIT: I notice the code is pretty garbled when I print it here, if it helps I can send it in a different medium.
You just need an OUTPUT statement on your PROC MEANS. There you will specify the output data set with OUT= and specify the variable names for your stats. You could just use STD=respstd and MEAN=respmean. By the way, I think the keyword should be STD instead of STDDEV. Good luck!
%put std_var=&amp;std_var.; Or remove noprint option. 
Sometimes summary statistics is a little different between proc sql and proc means. Check if proc means produces the desired statistics. If so use data _null_; set stdstat; call symput (std,'std_var'); Run;
Proc report with ods using output dataset from proc freq. Proc export to produce excel file. 
Any good papers for how to use REPORT or maybe an example? Im still a newbie. 
You can use Proc sql and the Dictionary tables. More on the Dictionary tables can be found here: http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/sugi31/259-31.pdf
I thought I tried that and it didn't work....Regardless, it worked on attempt #2. Ty!
Not tested, but this should work: %let name=Nick; %let i=3; %let lag1=Lag1; %put &amp;name.&amp;i.&amp;lag1.; For every macro variable call, begin with "&amp;" and end with ".", and you won't have ambiguity. Doing a macro of a macro (a macro array) is a different matter and requires &amp;&amp; or &amp;&amp;&amp;.
yeah turned out this was the case, had to check with 3 different IT departments to get the Libraries, engines and schemas I needed. Big companies are fun 
I was kind of in your position - started with no knowledge, and I'm about 2 months in now. My advice is start with the free e-course SAS Programming 1: Essentials that's available on their website. I use the SAS University edition to practice on and the course is helpful because they give you sample datasets and tell you how to manipulate them for practice problems, and from there you're free to manipulate them creatively and as you see fit. I still use the datasets from that e-course to practice 
%put &amp;Name.&amp;i.&amp;lag1; Remove &amp; and add . If &amp;nick3lag1 is a macro then you need to add an &amp; before name. 
Understand the PDV very well. Practice the programs in the book. Solve all of the exercise problems after every chapter. I'm assuming company has the SAS. It's a multiple choice questions. There are online question banks available for practice. SAS website also has sample questions, take their test just before the exam to learn to time yourself. 
Cool! I'll check it out
Yeah I've heard of that. I'll have to be on one of our SAS machines while i take the course online
Well, after you're done studying. If you still don't know what PDV is then please don't take the exam. :-) Good luck!!!
How much data do you have? I think you should start by trying to use a time series for forecasting since there is likely a seasonal component and possibly a increasing trend over time. SAS has a time series forecasting system you can use which is pretty powerful. If not, you can try to fit using regression methods or transform your data first using log, exponential, or some other methods. It's hard to give you exact hints and procedures without knowing much details about the data and purpose? is this an in-class assignment or work project? 
Just curious, what does MAD stand for? 
Mean absolute deviation 
In class assignment! So basically I have to build a forecasting model using a dataset beginning October 16, 1999 that spans 104 weeks. And the professor wants forecast equations for both 12 pack and 2 liter that he will use in predicting from the actual data on the various independent variables for October 13, 2001 to August 31, 2002. Variables I have are ID number, week in date format, pepsi 12 pack volume std units, pepsi 2 liter pack volume std units, pepsi 12 pack promotion dummy, pepsi 2 liter promotion dummy, coke 12 pack promotion dummy, coke 2 liter promotion dummy, pepsi 12 pack price, pepsi 2 liter price, coke 12 pack price, coke 2 liter price, pepsi 12 pack volume t-1, pepsi 2 liter volume t-1, weeks since Oct 9, 1999, and many holiday and season dummies (like Labor day/Spring/so forth)
mmmm I see. From my understanding you have both coca-cola and pepsi data but you just want to forecast pepsi prices? since you have (relatively) plenty of data, I would suggest you build a time series model. One approach is to use the difference between coke sales and pepsi sales to just model by that directly since I assume coke and pepsi would be affected by the same holidays and similar promotions. You can also model each product and size separately and include the dummy variables to see if there are any patterns. But there are many approaches on how you can do this so it's really up to you. To test your model, you can keep like 2 weeks of data as a holdout sample and find the MAD using that to select a model to see if your models are overfitting or not. You can also use SIC/AIC as a criteria as well. If you are really ambitious, you could also find sales information for each product since both companies are publicly traded and should be able to locate some form of indicator of their sales performances somewhere. 
Awesome! Thank you so much - really appreciate the help!
Alright- I"ll look into that tomorrow... I'm not 100% certain I know what you mean, but I have no problem working with the data to see if it works. 
Sorry- I'm sure this is confusing. I essentially have 10 years of data and want to run negative binomial regressions, my population data is set up by age group not single year age. So I have to set up the data by each county, then by age group, then by the type of disease (shown here as a binomial variable), then total number of cases in that year in that age group. Essentially I will have data lines like this: Washington County 15-20 year old Meningitis 14 cases 2007 Washington County 10-14 year old Meningitis 37 cases 2007 Indiana County 10-14 year old Meningitis 0 cases 2007 But my current data set only has it by single age year: Washington County 15 year old Meningitis 3 cases 2007 Washington County 10 year old Meningitis 7 cases 2007 Washington County 11 year old Meningitis 13 cases 2007 Washington County 12 year old Meningitis 8 cases 2007 Washington County 13 year old Meningitis 4 cases 2007 Washington County 14 year old Meningitis 5 cases 2007 Indiana County 11 year old Meningitis 0 cases 2007 So the cases in Washington county of meningitis in the age group of 10-14 will add up to 37, I just can't figure out how to make it work. I've done it previously with Proc SQL for population numbers (a year ago), and I can send you the code, but I can't get it to work now. Let me know if this still doesn't make sense. Thanks for your help. I really appreciate it. I think I got the formatting down now. 
I guess this is my issue- I don't remember what these mean. Test is the table... that much I understand, but I'm not sure what your grp_var is corresponding with.. Also, is N from DIN group the number of total? or are you looking at disease? 
 Create table test as select year, case when age&lt;15 then '&lt;15' when age&lt;20 then '15-20' when age&lt;25 then '20-25' else '25+' end as age_grp, disease, sum(total) as N from din group by age_grp, year, disease; quit;
If replace your PUT _ALL_ with PUT (_ALL_) (=) then it will suppress the automatic variables. data _NULL_; set TESTSQL; file NINJA; put (_ALL_) (=); run; Edit: oh the underscores in my first sentence dropped off like yours did. See the code for what I was saying specifically to do 
You can use \` characters to write inline `code` snippets.
Just in case this is of interest - I came across the following recently for creating fixed-width files (as opposed to delimited): http://stackoverflow.com/a/32934351/667489
Thanks. I'll try this.
Thanks! I always forget that
Thanks. I actually want to output whatever I pull out from the query. There are way too many variables. I just simplified the query here to explain my problem.
* Series plot; PROC SGPLOT DATA = Weather; SERIES X = Month Y = BRain; SERIES X = Month Y = VRain; SERIES X = Month Y = LRain; TITLE 'Average Monthly Rainfall in Olympic Cities'; RUN; 
You can indent by 4 lines or a tab to format text as code. E.g. code here You can also use \`characters to produce `inline code`.
Yeah. I was being lazy with mobile. So just copy pasted. 
This may be what you're looking for: http://support.sas.com/kb/24/932.html. I'd need to play with it to know for sure, but hopefully it will put you on the right track. 
The lag() function may help here. Can't remember it of the top of my head but I'm sure you can swot up on it. 
data new; set old; if prxmatch('/\^(D|E|F|G)/i', your_char_var_here) then sort_indicator=0; else sort_indicator=1; run; proc sort data=new; by sort_indicator; run;
As a student that has used your tutorials as supplement to my actual SAS course. Thank you so much. I envy your knowledge of SAS. Somehow I do poorly with it, no matter how hard I try. 
Possibly something like: IF SUBSTR(myVar,1,1) IN ('D','E','F','G','H'); IF POS('DEFGH',SUBSTR(myVar,1,1)) &gt; 0;
Never having properly learned SAS graphics, I would default to the menu bar: Tools &gt; ODS Graphic Designer Create a graphic and capture the auto-code snippet for reproducible syntax.
do I need to manually change the excel spreadsheet so it says a24 or is there a way to make it read as a24 within sas
Just insert a row below your existing header row and put this in it (starting with cell A2) and copy across: "a"&amp;a1 Then copy the new row and "paste special"over itself, choosing "Values." Then you can delete row 1. Sorry if you didn't need all that detail. Just thought I'd post it in case.
Technically you can use spaces, but you have to enclose the name in quotes and append the letter "n" to the end.
This is the answer you need OP, refer to the column as '24'n to force sas to treat it as a variable. 
Great, that is what I was hoping--wasn't sure how vulnerable data is while being read.
The data step posted above is relatively safe - SAS builds up a temporary file and only replaces the original once execution is complete. However, if your data step contains a `modify` statement, or you are using `proc datasets` / `proc append` to append datasets, irreversible damage can occur if execution is interrupted. `proc sql` can overwrite input datasets, but I think it disallows this by default - you have to explicitly allow it by setting `undo_policy = none` or `optional` in the `proc sql` statement. Otherwise, it complains in the log. I'd suggest you look into generation datasets if you are particularly concerned about preventing damage from accidental overwriting, and audit trails/integrity constraints if you are concerned about inappropriate data being appended/inserted.
P.S. indent by 4 spaces or a tab when posting blocks of code, or quote with \` characters for `inline code`.
I might be able to help. Depends on the dataset. You may be able to use the data set as the codebook with some simple work. Give me an example of what you are trying to accomplish. 
I'm not familiar with PROC CODEBOOK, and I can't get it to open on my phone, but you should be able to make something useful with PROC CONTENTS with an OUT= statement. For each directory where your data sets reside, just use "PROC CONTENTS DATA=MYLIB.\_all\_;" where MYLIB is the libname for the directory. The output data sets that you get from the various data sources can then be set together. The next thing I would do is open that data set in Excel. Then you can easily customize it and decide which elements you want to keep 
Slightly wrong syntax. proc contents data=ct._all_ out=ct_cb noprint; run; This will write the output to `work.ct_cb`. To profile all library members the keyword is `_all_` instead of `all`. If you want the report output, remove the `noprint` statement.
&gt;[Multiple INPUT statements, one for each record, can read each record into a single observation.](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/basess/58133/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a002001051.htm) Your second input statement wouldn't read anything. So just do: INPUT Name $ Score ; INPUT ; I think that should do it. 
If there is a consistent pattern of gibberish and non-gibberish lines then you can do this with just a single `input` statement, using line controls (`#`) and possibly the `n=` option on the corresponding `infile` statement.
Note it's _SGSRT2_ (with underscores), not SGSRT2. It's probably a temporary dataset that SGPANEL creates. It's empty for some reason, causing it to error. So it's probably one of these issues: - (more likely) there's an error in your code or a problem with your data, e.g. "ind" or "time" or "limit" is not in your dataset, or one of the variables has a large degree of missingness - (less likely) there's an actual bug in PROC SGPANEL. (You could also run a: OPTIONS MPRINT; at the top of your program, which may show some of the inner workings of PROC SGPANEL in your log, but it's probably difficult to follow.)
Can you just post it so that other users can give their input as well? Or is it sensitive information?
SAS does not have a limit for records. I don't know why you're running into this issue but you're using some syntax that I don't think is entirely necessary. You could use PROC IMPORT or maybe try this: Data all; INFILE "C:\CRInput\MER165_PLX_Orig.CPLC" truncover lrecl=30000; input all $2000.; type=scan(all,1,'|'); row=\_N\_; run; In any case, it would help us help you if you responded to questions. 
It doesn't like your "row=\_N\_" statement. I'm using SAS 9.3 by the way.
Weird, \_N_ is an automatic variable. In any case, I'm glad you got it figure out. 
Wait seriously? I take back what I said then.
Ya - enterprise installs are even more. Runs $35k/yr for us. SAS is not cheap. $50 is giving it away.
Again apologies.
What is the problem?
I've installed SAS on Windows 8 with no problem, so it can be done. Try running the installer as admin by right clicking on it and choosing run as admin.
Look up for data sets in UCI data library. I'm not sure how you can upload your own data set into sas. But there should be a way. And the library contains rich collection on wide range of topics. First thing you have to do in any data analysis job is to study the dataset and understand the variables role and importance. 
Thanks a lot for the reply. I didn't know about the uci database. It's looks really good!
What do you want to do ? How big and variety is your dataset?
Proc reg data=dataname; model y=x; run; Dataname is the data set. y is the variable you want to predict. X is the variable you want to use to predict y. 
Just curious, what are you trying to accomplish exactly? I would be inclined to just use a "set" statement in the data step.
Do you want to use INFILE and SET statement together?
I'm not an expert in SAS, but using INFILE and / to read records from a SAS dataset seems kind of unintuitive to me. I'm not saying it *won't* work that way, (because I haven't tried) but if the records are already read into a SAS dataset, it's sounds like it'd be quicker to use the appropriate DROP or KEEP statements to create a new dataset consisting of only the subset of variables you're interested in. 
Thanks, here's an example of what I mean that i got from the SAS documentation; data club2; input IdNumber 1-4 / / StartWeight 1-3 EndWeight 5-7; datalines; 1023 David Shaw red 189 165 1049 Amelia Serrano yellow 145 124 1219 Alan Nance red 210 192 1246 Ravi Sinha yellow 194 177 1078 Ashley McKnight red 127 118 1221 Jim Brown yellow 220 . ; proc print data=club2; title 'Weight Club Members'; run; So in the example above you can read in a record from the datalines and then skip a couple of records using // to the third record and read in a couple more variables from there to create your new record of three variables. Basically I was wondering how this could be accomplished using the SET statement... 
Just pm me your email and I can send you some SAS stuff.
I think what you are trying to accomplished could be done using the Output; statement. The output satement will allow you to output only the current row on the PDV to the named data step in the data.
That's a little hard to follow, but my guess would be that educat doesn't exist in nhanes.adults. Your part A answer creates an variable called educat in a dataset called Adults1, but this dataset isn't referenced in part B - indeed the dataset name Adults1 is reused. Short answer - check in nhanes.adults to see if educat exists. If it doesn't, it's created and set to missing (.) when your part B data step runs, hence the default format. Edit:just realised this was a week ago :P hope you got it sorted!
If by "spline" you mean a time point that must be continuous but may shift in slope and if your "spline" is determined by time then you need only add a coded dummy variable that is 0 if t &lt; t_spline and 1 if t &gt; t_spline. Then your model should appear as: B0 + B1 x time + ~~B2 x spline~~ + B3 x Group + B4 x Group x time + B5 x Group x spline + B6 x Age The B2 term allows for a complete discontinuity in the time course which is not really a spline at all. I would take it further and suggest that you redefine time to be time - t_spline so that the break point is the center of your time course. Finally, you do not include the B7 x Spline x time or the B8 x Spline x Group x time. I think you need these terms. And yes, you need to use estimate or constrasts (or LSMEstimate) statements.
Look into the outputs PREDICTED. There is an output method that already does what you are asking. I would use this yhat instead of doing it manually. https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63347/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_reg_sect015.htm 
What happens when you take the log of both sides? 
Ohhhh ok, I got it, thanks a lot guys!!
Ello. I'm not near SAS right now but if nobody offers a suggestion before tomorrow I'll knock something together and post here. To give you something to work with, I'd suggest that one approach would be to sort your initial dataset by Subject and Date. Then use a data step with a by clause and assign a counter as you've suggested - if first.subject then counter = 1; else counter+1; (or similar). Then you can use the counter to decide which date variable to populate - if counter = 1 then DateofFirstIncident = Date; else if counter = 2 then DateofSecondIncident = Date; (and so on). You'll need to use retain for this to work properly - somewhere above this code have the line 'retain DateofFirstIncident DateofSecondIncident Dateof.....: That way when you reach the last record for a subject, all approoriate date variables should be populated. Final bit - if last. Subject then output; So you get one record per Subject. Rough and ready I know :P but should work. Oh yeah, you'll want to reset the new date variables to missing at each first. Subject. Have fun!
So first you need to add a counter to your data. You can do this within each subject using the FIRST. automatic variable when you set data with a BY variable. To do this, you'll need to sort your data. Sort by Subject and Date, that will organize your observations by date within Subject. Then create a new data set where you set your old data set BY Subject and Date. This creates the (temporary and automatic) FIRST. variable which will help you reset the counter every time a new subject is encountered. The logic is: if it's not the first time the subject is encountered, you'll want to add 1 to the counter. (The first time you hit a subject you reset the counter to 0, then immediately add 1. This is your first record. The next record is not the first in the subject so the counter isn't reset and then you add another 1 making your counter = 2. The COUNTER + 1 ; statement is called a sum statement and has an implicit RETAIN so the counter won't reset at every observation.) Proc Sort Data = Old Out = Old_Sorted ; By Subject Date ; Run ; Data Counter ; Set Old ; By Subject Date ; If First.Subject Then Counter = 0 ; Counter + 1 ; Run; Then you need to transform your data using an array. Data Wide ; Array _DateIncident {#} DateIncident1 - DateIncident# ; Array _DateFollowUp {#} DateFollowUp1 - DateFollowUp# ; Do Until (Last.Subject) ; Set Counter ; By Subject ; _DateIncident {Counter} = Date ; _DateFollowUp {Counter} = DateFollowUp ; End ; Run ; In this data step, you're creating two arrays (you can create more if you have more variables you want to transform, but I only did two since that's what you need in your example). Both should have the "#" replaced by the MAX number of incidents per subject. Otherwise you'll get an out of range error. The SET statement is within the DO loop, because you want to read multiple observations from your first data set when creating the new data set (I can explain more on this, but I'll leave it out for now). Then you're using the Counter variable you created above to tell the new data set which old observation goes in which variable in the array in your new data set. This is probably really confusing, but hopefully it helps. Feel free to ask questions. Also, I'm doing this off the top of my head, so if I made any errors, definitely let me know. (I probably did.)
Why are you using url shorteners?
Yeah, I figured it could be simplified, but I preferred doing it this way to point out the way it works a bit more explicitly. I'm glad this is right though. Since I never checked the syntax or anything. 
For brevity, as some of the URLs are long. Both of these links resolve to SAS websites: communities.sas.com and blogs.sas.com.
you can use a data step (either set or merge statement) or use proc sql;
Thanks so much for the reply. The data sets are all quarterly bank information with the same variables and banks (with identifiers) but with varying financial info. My goal was to take each quarter and its respective financial information and merge them together into one data set. I have been told I can use the PROC SQL method to help do this but not sure what that looks like in merging the data sets.
I feel like merge or proc sql will be my best bet. I have to head back to campus on Tuesday to give it a try. Thanks for pointing me in the right direction!
You can use a SAS MERGE or you can use PROC SQL. But that would give you one wide file with all of the financial elements in it. You'll need to have key fields to use to bring them together. PROC SQL gives you more control over the variables you bring together and what type of join you want to do. But the merge will let you create multiple data sets from the same merge. I'd definitely recommend that you start going through some merge and PROC SQL examples in the documentation and try experimenting with your data. As long as you're careful not to overwrite your data, you won't hurt anything by playing with it.
When you set up the VM, you should have defined a folder somewhere accessible from your local OS (probably on your C drive if you're running this on Windows) which is mounted by the guest OS within the VM as /folders/myfolders. You need to find that folder in your local OS and put files there in order for SAS to be able to see them. The way to do this depends on which VM host you're using. E.g. for Virtualbox, it should be listed under Machine &gt; Settings &gt; Shared Folders (provided that the VM is currently running).
thanks u/kzig I've done this. It seems to be a problem specifically related to using .sas7bdat files. My virtual machine can see it and I can open this file. However, I can't seem to find out how to read it in to a sas program using libname to do some data manipulations. From what I can gather I need to select the file upload it to a sas server and then read it in. cheers!
Thanks for that. But its really more a conceptual question i think
A `libname` statement doesn't read a SAS file - it's just a way of telling SAS that you have a folder or some sort of database where you want to work with SAS datasets. To read a SAS dataset, you need to use a `set` statement as part of a data step, or run a proc that reads it in. E.g. to assign a library pointing to your mount folder and create a copy of the sashelp.class dataset there, you could try this: libname example "/folders/myfolders"; data example.class; set sashelp.class; run; 
As a general rule in SAS, you should avoid creating lots of little files - it's much easier to work with your data when it's all in one place. You can do this via a merge: data merged /view=merged; merge mydata1 mydata1; run; I've specified a view here as this avoids creating an extra copy of all the underlying data. You don't mention whether there is any unique key variable in either of the input datasets - if there is, the usual thing to do with a merge is to sort both datasets first, then add a `by keyvar;` statement. As written above, it will just merge the n^th rows of each input dataset, so you'll get missing values if one has more rows than the other. 
PM'd you.
So you want someone to do your homework for you. Yesterday it was worth $5 and now it's worth $40...
you'll need a macro loop to output each of these. you'll also need to rename the columns in there. i'm not sure of the easiest way to rename the columns. the loop looks something like %macro reddit(); %do i = 1 %to 3; data new_dataset&amp;i; set dataset1 dataset2; keep v&amp;i.; run; %end; %mend; %reddit;
Yes, this is absolutely possible. There's an example of how to do this in the SAS online documentation: http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/hostunx/61879/HTML/default/viewer.htm#email.htm Try googling for _data-driven programming_ to get some more general examples that may be relevant for what you're doing. Depending on your environment, another option would be to set up an email distribution list, send emails only to the list, and require the relevant staff to add themselves to it. 
Does MONTH exist in the data set temporary?
Woah there Jason, it's ok, we'll get through this :) I'm assuming your variable MONTH is the text equivalent of a number (for example, "01"). Using MONTH*1 is sloppy programming, and I don't recommend it. Try Data New; Set Old; Month_Numeric=input(month,best.); Run; Then run your histogram on the new variable
There isn't really a "should." Either will work fine. I like the words because they're easier to read and are also usually easier for others to understand if they inherit your code.
Thought this might be a good future reference document for you as well "Date and Time Intervals" http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lefunctionsref/63354/HTML/default/viewer.htm#p0syn64amroombn14vrdzksh459w.htm
I think PROC transpose is terrible. It's much cleaner to use the data step, in my opinion. 
Good point. However, transpose "removes" the contents of your other variables for a good reason. If they are the same for each clustered observation (e.g., separate first and last name fields), then the "by" command works great. If they are different for each clustered observation (e.g., state of residence which may change over time), then the data step version will essentially arbitrarily choose one of the states, which is dangerous!
You're right, I was happy to leave the decision to the OP :) having said that, I would certainly use transpose.
Needing to transpose more than one variable is reason enough not to use PROC TRANSPOSE. The unnecessary \_NAME_ variable, losing all the other data, ugly variable names. There are lots of reasons. 
Thanks for the link but that data set has only sales records. I want the complete data record as mentioned in the books.
It says the following right in the beginning of the PROC ARIMA documentation: &gt; Before you use PROC ARIMA, you should be familiar with Box-Jenkins methods, and you should exercise care and judgment when you use the ARIMA procedure. The ARIMA class of time series models is complex and powerful, and some degree of expertise is needed to use them correctly. If you can't understand the basic syntax of the procedure, you shouldn't be using it. Sorry but it's the truth. It took me a long time to learn to use Box-Jenkins models properly.
No one ever answered this. One way is to just create a new variable (call it hypo_weight), with the following values: 1 = age 23, weight group 1 2 = age 23, weight group 2 3 = age 23, weight group 3 4 = age 30, weight group 1 and so on, to give values 1 to 9. Graph using this new variable (no group or subgroup at all). Format it accordingly. Use a split character (see the "split" option in gchart) to make the labels of the x-axis break in the right spots.
About the SAS Folder Structure is a good resource to view: https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/bisag/64088/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a003251911.htm 
I know them very well. My degree is in statistics with a focus in time series analysis. 
Can you install SAS on a Windows server and then just access it like university edition on different machines? I thought that was the point of SAS studio? And when I said I have a lot of data but not THAT much I was more saying I will be working in the millions, not billions. I know a lot of people say they have big data when the reality is far from that. 
Glad you figured it out!
This link may help, which takes you to all book example code &amp; data: http://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/code.samples.html. Are you using SAS University Edition? Also, which book?
No, I'm using SAS Studio. The SAS essential course is available for free currently. I found the code to build Orion datasets in the course itself. I was talking about official SAS books. Thank you for your help.
Gotcha! If needed, SAS does have Curriculum Consultants, which are a great resource: training@sas.com. Hope this helps :) 
Sure! It sounds like you've started SAS Programming 1 -- Statistics 1 is another free e-Learning course: https://support.sas.com/edu/elearning.html?ctry=us. These free tutorials are also handy: http://support.sas.com/training/tutorial/. Lastly, a few recommended books on getting started with SAS: https://www.sas.com/store/books/categories/getting-started/cBooks-cbooks_categories-cbooks_categories_3-p1.html! 
Yes, i'm doing the Base course from the first link you provided. I will take the Statistics 1 course too. Thank you for the other two links.
what do you have so far?
absolutely nothing, first time i'm working with a linear equation in SAS. I thought I could somehow have it loop the x values 1-20 with a do statement and then sum them, but frankly i don't even know the syntax for it. 
that's a good start, but you're going to end up with only one row, yes? I can give you the answer here, but this is homework, I'm trying to just help guide you.
An array shouldn't be needed.
data y; do i=1 to 20; function=3+2*i-.08*i**2; end; total=sum(of 1-20); run; 759 data y; 760 do i=1 to 20; 761 function=3+2*i-.08*i**2; 762 end; 763 total=sum(of 1-20); - 22 ERROR 22-322: Syntax error, expecting one of the following: !, !!, &amp;, (, *, **, +, ',', -, /, &lt;, &lt;=, &lt;&gt;, =, &gt;, &gt;&lt;, &gt;=, AND, EQ, GE, GT, LE, LT, MAX, MIN, NE, NG, NL, OR, [, ^=, {, |, ||, ~=. 764 run; NOTE: The SAS System stopped processing this step because of errors. WARNING: The data set WORK.Y may be incomplete. When this step was stopped there were 0 observations and 4 variables. WARNING: Data set WORK.Y was not replaced because this step was stopped. NOTE: DATA statement used (Total process time): real time 0.01 seconds cpu time 0.01 seconds 
reddit changed the 2 star i to 2i. i could do solve for the expression 20 times but the professor wants us to use the do statement so that it automatically loops. 
so... data Function; do i=1-20; y=3+(2 * i)-(0.08 * ( i * * 2)); output; end; run; 
Give it a shot and then check the log and output data! (also, there's nothing saying you have to use i, you can do x = if you want)
oooooh yeah, it bloody worked. I kept messing up with 1-20 instead of 1 to 20.
Rock and roll... Do you know how to do the cumulative column?
hahaha, no, trying to figure that out without having to use proc print
you'll want to initialize the variable before the loop, then it's really easy. before the "do" write something like "total = 0;" just before the output write "total + function;" If you had groups here, you'd want to use "by" and reinitialize the total = 0, for example (by state; if first.state then total = 0; etc) let me know what you have here so far. should be almost done.
This worked out: data A; do x= 1 to 20; y=3+(2*x)-(0.08*(x**2)); total+y; output; end; run;
Try to get a recruiting firm or "headhunter" to look for work for you. I used [Smith Hanley](http://jobs.smithhanley.com/) a number of years ago and they successfully got me a SAS job. There are many other such firms out there. (I do not represent or work for Smith Hanley; I'm just reporting my experience. This was also a long time ago; the job market may be more difficult now.)
Not sure if you've checked this site out before but perhaps it helps? http://www.sascommunity.org/wiki/Employment_opportunities
LinkedIn is a very good place. Update your profile and recruiters will come. Apply to companies in your field or to your current competitor. Which country and which field?
USA Finance currently. Data &amp; reporting. 
Thanks! I'm just trying to find "non-traditional" avenues now. 
I was trying to avoid it but I couldn't figure out a way to do that. I had a table with 200k rows with 100 columns. It had to be summarized in a weird way where everything was on row based on 1 identifier. Sometimes things got summarized based on other characteristics, sometimes it didn't. There wasn't consistency to the data. The 100 columns is about to be 5000 columns. I tried so many ways to transpose it, proc summary it, proc append, proc sql with dictionary.table and couldn't get it to work. I was able to figure out a way to do it eventually. Also that list of 1000+ data tables became 5000+ data tables all back to 1.
If your datasets all begin with the same name prefix (lets say your datasets were named data_1 - data_1000), try this: data merge_data; set CDRIVE.data_: ; run;
It sounds like you already figured it out, but this might be a good candidate for creating the code in Excel. You can just paste the list of data sets in and then create the set/merge statement conditionally, one data set in each row. Excel can be a huge time saver for repetitive code.
Yeah, I've done that too. Complex graphing in SAS can be a pain, especially if you have to get into annotate datasets and such. Good luck!
What part of the USA are you located in? My company uses SAS across the entire enterprise. Headquartered in Atlanta, but we have some operational offices in Orlando and Richmond (not sure if any SAS related work is done in those offices). Also try contacting your local and regional SAS users group. Usually the admin of the group can send a blast with your resume out to the group. As already mentioned in this thread, LinkedIn is also a great option. Every time I make any kind of update to my profile (large or small) I get a lot of hits from headhunters.
This is probably the easiest way. You will need to rename the variables when you append the data sets. 
 data newset; set yourset; output; aaa=bbb; _1=_2; * variable name cannot be 1; output; drop bbb _2; run;
The class statement needs the name of categorical variables in it and will then do the dummy coding for those automatically. 
Did I not do that though?
It depends. What exactly is the variable first, second, etc? Are they 1/0 variables if that rank was first?
As far as I can see, you're putting the actual variable values into the Class statement ("first", "second", "third" etc), you should put the variable name into the Class statement, so "Placement" (Since that is your dependent variable") So your code should be: Proc GLM data=work.f1stats; Class Placement (and ofc all other categorical variables) Model Placement= FirstPlaceWins NumberOfFastestLaps etc FirstPlaceWins*NumberOfFastestLaps etc; Run; I'm not sure if this will solve your overall problem, but it is a mistake I can see in your coding.
Proc GLM data=work.IMPORT; Class Placement First Second Third Fourth Fifth Sixth Seven Eight Nine Tenth; Model Placement= NumOfFastLaps NumOfPodiums NumOfFirst NumOfOneTwo NumOfPolePositions NumOfFastLaps * NumOfPodiums * NumOfFirst * NumOfOneTwo * NumOfPolePositions; Run; This gives me the following errors ERROR: Variable THIRD not found. ERROR: Variable FOURTH not found. ERROR: Variable FIFTH not found. ERROR: Variable SIXTH not found. ERROR: Variable SEVEN not found. ERROR: Variable EIGHT not found. ERROR: Variable NINE not found. ERROR: Variable TENTH not found. NOTE: The previous statement has been deleted. 58 Model Placement= NumOfFastLaps NumOfPodiums NumOfFirst NumOfOneTwo NumOfPolePositions 58 ! NumOfFastLaps*NumOfPodiums*NumOfFirst*NumOfOneTwo*NumOfPolePositions; ERROR: Variable Placement in list does not match type prescribed for this list. NOTE: The previous statement has been deleted. 59 Run; My excel data definitely has those variables in the correct column and everything.
Alright so I "dumbed down" my goals a little following your advice. This is my current code Proc glm data=work.import3; Model FirstPlace = NumOfFastLaps NumOfPodiums NumOfFirst NumOfOneTwo NumOfPolePositions NumOfFastLaps*NumOfPodiums*NumOfFirst*NumOfOneTwo*NumOfPolePositions; Run; This works without errors. I've changed dependent variable to whether or not they won first place. 1 being yes and 0 being no. It seems(?) to be doing what it's intending. Correlation is only .53, this makes sense though because like you said linear correlation doesn't really make sense with this data. You mentioned Ordinal logistic regression, I think this is what i want, but it's definitely not as straight forward as I'd like. I created a program using it anyway just to see, I didn't receive any errors, and after reading output explanations about logistic results, I THINK it's working as intended. Here is the code for that. data ferraristats1; set work.import3; if FirstPlace = 1 then Won = 1; if Firstplace = 0 then Won = 0; run; proc logistic data = ferraristats1 desc; model Won = NumOfFastLaps NumOfPodiums NumOfFirst NumOfOneTwo NumOfPolePositions / expb; run; Granted this code was mainly found online and fitted to my needs. Would this work if I could figure out what the output means?
That's awesome. Thanks again!!!
Thanks! Edit: I thought there was something wrong but there isn't! THANKS!!!
The language is the same. But you are a bit late to learn now, SAS assessments can cover many things.
I know the job involves importing and exporting csv/xls files and analyzing the data to find trends. I know how to do all of that is SAS studio. How similar would it be to SAS?
If you're trying to collapse some non-mutually exclusive variables down into one categorical variable, you need to make some decisions. If you want your categories to be like so: * 1 = public school * 2 = public magnet or public choice * 3 = vocational or other So (as an example), if a school selects both "public magnet" and "vocational", would you want them to be a "2" or a "3"? A PROC FREQ with TABLE A1*A2*A3*A4*A5 /list missing; (where the A variables here are your original variables) will show you what combinations you have. EDIT: See also /r/SurveyResearch/
What you should say is that you have some experience with SAS Studio. Tell them that you have lots of experiences in all sorts of programming languages including other statistics and math packages such as MATLAB and Maple, and that you're confident you can pick up SAS fairly quickly because you know how to teach yourself code. And then tell them you did some digging found some online tutorials and that you can see that regular SAS and SAS studio seem to use a lot of the same concepts and that you obviously know you'll need to put some time in to truly master it, but you think you have the basics down and can learn quickly. My goto answer for this situation is "what i've learned from my experience in programming, is that learning the programming language is secondary to the task at hand. When I teach statistics to college students (which i occasionally do) I tell my students to not focus on learning SPSS or SAS but instead learn the statistical procedure. And once you understand that, learning how to do it in a computer program is a lot easier because you know exactly what you're trying to get the program to do." Obviously, if they want a SAS expert, well you're not that. But if they want someone who is a good analyst or whatever, and you can demonstrate that you have the chops to learn SAS fairly quickly, then this will help. Also, you can import/export csv/xls data sets through point and click. file &gt; import data/export data to bring up the wizard. go on the internet tonight and find how to do proc freq for frequencies and crosstabs, and proc means for basic measures of central tendency. Good luck.
I recommend repeatedly practicing lessons from the SAS Programming textbooks. I did that and got certified. As an aside, I recommend preparing more for the Base SAS test because it was harder than the Advanced SAS and SAS Enterprise Miner tests.
I guess it depends on your brother's level of expertise in this area, but the book, "The Signal and the Noise" by Nate Silver is a pretty good book for the layperson. It is about how statistically driven prediction works in many fields including the business world. It's not an instructional book or anything like that, but I think it's probably a good primer on analytics in general.
Thanks for your suggestion and maybe I should have been a little more specific. He has a good idea of it all so is there a some sort of "medium" level of knowledge in it? Or even just one or two steps up from a beginners type of knowledge 
Um...well, in terms of statistics? Not really. But he does go into detail about some economic models that the average person may or may not be aware of, ie - he goes into what Bayesian economics is and how to model using the principles of this field. But there is no technical instruction per se, just broad outlines of some of the schools of thought in the prediction business that he has observed. Again, it was really designed for the lay person, so it keeps technical explanation to a minimum, but I wouldn't say that it's "prediction for dummies" or anything like that. If nothing else, it's just a decent read that will either confirm what your brother already knows or give him new things to chew on.

If this is just a one-off, define another variable that's equal to 1 for 2006-2008 and 2 for 2009-2011 and summarise across that.
Yes, "/list missing" is a great way to handle more than one variable in a proc freq. It's usually much easier than using separate dimensions. Also, it's a great idea to always use "/missing" with all of your freqs.
Very elegent. Glad you found a solution!
Thanks for the reply. The original date (201512) is Numeric so I am receiving and syntax error "input requires character argument". So would I add another Put statement to convert "Date Field" to numeric? Put(Input(Put("Date Field",6.),yymmn6.),mmddyy10.) Edit: adjusted the formula Edit2: this worked, thank you for the help
Hi Harsh, You could play with formats and do a simple conversion, but I hate doing that. Here's an example that may provide you with the solution you're looking for. data Example1; DateOld = 201512; format DateNew Date9.; Day = 1; Month = Input(SubStrn(DateOld,5,2),best.); Year = input(SubStrn(DateOld,1,4),best.); DateNew = mdy(month,day,year); run; Or, combine this into a single step: Data Example2; DateOld = 201512; Format DateNew Date9.; DateNew = MDY(Input(SubStrn(DateOld,5,2),best.),1,input(SubStrn(DateOld,1,4),best.)); Run;
We recently changed our date format over to YYYYMM, but some of my reports to other departments still require the MMDDYYYY so im just converting them after the process has run. Thanks again!
Yeah, the code side. I'd recommend learning the basics. GL, and message me if you need help.
This is what the variance section looks like by the way: Variance Explained by Each Factor Factor1 1.0588634 Factor2 0.6239239 
do your homework.
Thanks! Also do you know of a way so that 1 will appear 20% ,2 will appear 20%, and so on? 
That should get you pretty close, but if you want it to be exact, assign random numbers with: randnum = ranuni(0);. Then sort by randnum and assign exactly 20% to each based on \_N\_. If you need help coding that, let me know.
Thank you for all your help!! Also would the floor function work the same as the int function? 
You're welcome! And yes, as long as the numbers are positive (which they will be in this case), int and floor are the same.
If the date/time is in that format as text, split it out by using a substr and read the date and time sections separately. Then put each part into the format you want and input into the desired datetime informat.
There are some recommendations including sample questions, publications, etc listed under "Exam Preparation" http://support.sas.com/certify/creds/ct.html#s1=2
If you're still in school, try registering on SAS.com with your school email address and take a look at the E-learning options. There's an outside chance that you'll be able to get into the corresponding courses for free. 
Nice. My coworker developed a similar process for running SAS from Python: https://github.com/wharton/inlinesas We use it for automation, but also to get SAS data into a Pandas dataframe: https://github.com/wharton/sasdataframe
Awesome!
A SAS library is just a directory. The only special property it may have is presence of SAS data files. 
If you want a listing of libraries you've assigned in your current session, try `libname _all_ list;`.
Initially I've been accessing data by adding pre-set libraries. I was just given a list of them in this sort of format: libname SDR ODBC DATASRC=IDPSAND schema=SDR USER=XXXXXX PASSWORD=XXXXXXXX; Now I am trying to get access to information from a new system, they've given me the datasrc and schema, but no library name. I've tried the schema name as the library name since that's how some of the others were, but no luck. Is there anyway to find the library, or find out where data with this specific schema is located or anything like that?
The library name is SDR. It's always the first argument after the libname statement. It seems like you're connection isn't working.
No, I understand that, that was just an example of another one i have access to that does work properly. I have another different one where I know the schema and datasrc but I do not know the name of the library. 
You'd need to use an INDEX function to apply the country codes in a data step before you merge. Just search for each of the country name strings in the field. But be careful -- keep in mind that SAS will accept the first match to the string if you use a select statement or else-if logic. For example, put Nigeria in the list before Niger. Also, you may have to use more than one statement with Congo and some others -- find 'Congo' and 'Demo'. Don't forget to use UPCASE if the case of your data is inconsistent.
thanks for the tip!
Maybe someone could add on to my answer since I haven't worked with it in a very long time, but, if you use dummy variables you encode them as 0/1 variables so you don't have to add them to the Class statement since they'll be numeric. I think your first implementation would work where you specify the raw predictor variables in the class statement and then use them directly in the model statement. 
Two thoughts (SAS Admin here) 1) Is the Excel file big? I know it sounds simple, but if the excel file has a lot of data in it, it's going to take a while to load. 2) Is the Excel file stored on hardware that's particularly slow? E.g. Is it stored on a network drive, with a slow connection to the SAS server? Is it stored on a drive in another country? Your normal data steps etc, are (I assume) querying SAS datasets, stored on hardware that's designed for the I/O demands of SAS - the kinds of places you'd store excel may not have ever factored this kind of intensive I/O activity into the design.
I'd recommend copying the Excel file locally if it's on a remote server. Reading data remotely is horribly slow. If that doesn't resolve it, use SAS ODBC and create an ODBC Connection to the file. Then use create an ODBC libname and read the data in that way. 
Your proc glm statement is almost right. For the model statement, you need: Model outcome = predictor1 predictor2 predictor1*predictor2 predictor1*predictor3; if you are not assuming an interaction between predictor2 and predictor 3. You shouldn't dummy code your ordinal variables as you will lose their ordering, which is important information about your model. Check out this link for more info on ways to code your variables: http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/sas/webbooks/reg/chapter5/sasreg5.htm
Have you tried exporting/importing the file as a csv text file?
You don't need to give any category a zero value. Usually what you do is give them numbers starting with 1, and then drop the one category you think would be the best as a reference, either in terms of statistical power or in terms of interpretation. You need to drop one category in order to estimate your model (dummy variable trap), which becomes *de facto* your reference, so that observations from your race of reference will be indeed left out. This simply means you don't include this one modality in your list of regressors. If I remember correctly that is the simplest way to proceed in SAS. Sometimes software procedures will drop one for you, and they usually take the category with the smallest modality.
 No, this is not what I am suggesting. And your comment made me realise that in your case, with races, my first answer was actually quite stupid. You can create as many dummies as there are races, and then zero would be all the other races instead of whites only, but this might be too many variables for one regression. Or you can just leave your categorical variable as it is, and include it in the regression, leaving out whites as your reference. This would imply you expect to see the same average effect when going from one category to another, something I had not realised when answering to you the first time but is a strong, if not silly, assumption, sorry about that. In this case (1=Whites, 2=Blacks, 3=Hispanics etc..), you might be better off using interaction terms (ie race x Dummy(Black)), which would give you the coefficient associated with 'people who are not white and are Black". This could be better if what you really want to use whites as a reference. 
Try the SASHELP library. It should come automatically setup in every SAS installation, and it's designed for this very purpose. SASHELP.CARS is my go to, contains about 250 rows of data about cars, including invoice amounts and (from memory) dates.
No way! That's totally awesome, thank you so much!
Here's another great resource to find data for learning! https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/Need-data-for-teaching-or-learning-Get-it-here/ta-p/221088
Can you track back an individual record to the source? SAS will not change the case unless there is code that changes it. The only exception I can think of is data set names. It will accept those in any case, but it will display them in uppercase.
I think you can see them in the sas registry editor solutions &gt; accessories &gt; registry editor Once in the registry editor, I think it's core &gt; options &gt; libnames and you can click on any of the libraries. Caveat - you are in a registry editor so this is high system level stuff, don't screw with anything unless you know what you're doing because if you screw something up it might break SAS. 
&gt;So Blk = 1, 0 = else. This will give you the coefficient associated with being Black compared to anything else. 
That's really strange. Are you using multiple character sets on that SAS instance? Is it possible there's a display issue on the source -- like underlying data in lowercase but altered to uppercase to display?
Can you submit a screen grab?
If a screen grab won't work, you might try copying the output into Notepad. That may improve the looks of it. You can also try increasing the line size and page size (LS and PS) in your OPTIONS statement in SAS.
Are you familiar with ODS? It stands for Output Delivery System put this before the proc report statement: &gt; ods tagsets.MSOffice2K style=statistical file="&lt;file path there you want the output\filename.xls&gt;"; and then this at the end: &gt; ods tagsets.MSOffice2k close; this will put the report into an excel file. some notes * the "MSOffice2K is just one of many types of output that ODS can deliver for you "tagsets.MSOffice2K" There is a tagset for excel specifically that lets you format columns and headers and stuff. Just google ODS for the full set of options. * the "statistical" in the "style = statistical" is basically a template. Again, you have more options. * the output file is actually an xml file that you force to have an .xls file type. But since excel can read xml, it will open up like a regular excel file. however, when you save it, if you just click on "save" it will save it as an html file. You have to change the type to xls or xlsx. * along with that, my computer used to do this thing where you get a message that says "file type doesn't match" or some crap like that when it tries to open the excel file after you run the ODS. Just click on open anyways, it's fine. There's a setting you can change in the registry to force it to recognize that it's an excel file, but i forget exactly what it is. again, google is your friend here.
&gt;can i only change the format in a proc format or data step? You can permanently change a format using the DATA step or PROC DATASETS. PROC FORMAT is for creating/managing formats and format libraries. &gt; Like lets say in a proc print, can i change the character with to 3? You can apply a temporary format in PROC PRINT. It will change how the data is presented, but it won't apply to any other steps. &gt;can i only create labels in a data or format step? You can change labels in the DATA step or PROC DATASETS. PROC FORMAT doesn't do anything to labels. &gt;Like if i just want to see my output with a different name, can i do this in the print step? PROC PRINT can print labels instead of variable names using the LABEL option in the PROC PRINT statement, but the label has to exist in the data set. You can't just add a label in PROC PRINT and have that printed. - With PROC SQL you can create output with a bit more flexibility. It's slightly different syntax and not always the most efficient, but it is an option if you don't want to mess with the data and create a cleaner report. There are other ways, but PROC SQL would probably be the simplest.
I fixed the problem by going to a computer somewhere else on my campus rather than using my own. HOWEVER, the headline in the proc report shows as "fffffff" all the way across. Any info on how I could correct this? Thanks. 
No idea what I did, but everything works fine now. Thanks for the help everyone!
You may have submitted a TITLE statement at some point. You can remove it by submitting "TITLE;" or change it by submitting "TITLE 'My new title';" If that doesn't clear it, the 'ffffff' title could be stored TITLE1, TITLE2, TITLE3, etc.
I think he's asking for some kind of inner join but all I keep thinking is i wanna join this whisky drinking business!

Are you trying to make a life table?
No I'm finding the inverse probability weights to be used in a marginal structural model (MSM). At this point I am working to replicate what [Hernan and colleagues did in R but using SAS](http://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v043i13/v43i13.pdf) Below is how it was accomplished in R (if you use R too): R&gt; startstop &lt;- data.frame(id = rep(basdat$id, each = length(times)),fuptime = rep(times, nrow(basdat))) R&gt; startstop &lt;- merge(startstop, basdat, by = "id", all.x = TRUE) R&gt; startstop &lt;- startstop[with(startstop, fuptime &lt;= Tend), ] where basdat is the "patient table" and times is the table of "unique event times".
Post your code, OP.

[Here](http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/jse_data_archive.htm) is an archive with tons of different types of data used in publications or teaching exercises. 
Start with the simple stuff first. SAS procedures, some basic data sets in your procedure sets. It is important to learn what the procedures do first then you design your data sources around the requirements of the procedures. Pick something like PROC MEANS. Then after you get that down move to doing the data infile step. Then after you get that down start looking at the macro command structures. You can find everything you need in the SAS student edition as well. 
Here are a few great (free) resources to get started learning SAS! Two free e-Learning classes -- 'SAS Programming 1' and 'Statistics 1': https://support.sas.com/edu/elearning.html?ctry=us.

Awesome! Thanks a ton. I'll add this to the mountain of studying I need to do every day. 
You could try to solve [this guys problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/sas/comments/3x4pqb/trying_to_replicate_observed_times_for_each/)
Go on the SAS website. They have a free intro to programming course. It's called something like "programming essentials 1." It's web based and they explain a lot of great concepts. Then work through the books. 
Do you want each subject to have all of the unique times? Or should each subject have all the times the other subjects had with blanks where no data is available? EDIT: why do subjects 2 and 3 not have timepoint 15? I think I can solve it if I can understand why 15 is missing. 
I can't access imgur at work, so I'm going blind here. if you use the index() function, you can get the position of a character in a string. if there will always be only 3 forward slashes, you can index the reverse() of the string to find the position of the last one. same idea to find .txt If there are more than 3 slashes possible, you may have to parse the string into temp variables at each slash.
You know, that's a good idea. I kept thinking of how to find the third slash, but you don't actually need that info.
Thanks. I'm not sure why OP decided to nest the functions, but w/e. 
I know you've solved it by now and the above comments were useful enough but I have another function I use a lot that you may find useful as well. The SUBSTR substring function. You specify a variable, the position of the character you want to begin your substring at, and the length of the desired substring. So if your path names are all the exact same length then SUBSTR could be used. e.g. ASCENSION = SUBSTR(path, 20, 20); This would begin the substring on the 20th character, use 20 further characters and then end the substring.
Ah, very clever! That would work. Thanks for the tips.
You're right, they should be there and I accidentally omitted those times.
This functionality has been around for at least 12 years (since SAS 9.1.3) - e.g. filename mycsvs ("c:\dir1\*.csv" "c:\dir2\*.csv"); data mydata; infile mycsvs ...; That reads everything in one step.
Well there you go. I didn't realize you could combine both into one filename. Thank you for the clarification. By the way, I've been programming in SAS since Version 6, so my chronology may be off a bit.
Is income a numeric variable?
yes: "What's your income?" Values are very large so I wanted to take the log of it for ease of interpretation. It creates the new variable properly so that's not an issue.
Sure you don't have a semi-colon missing from one of the preceding lines? 
Income is . in the records printed. Sure. [here](http://imgur.com/YMQnCuX) is a screengrab of the problematic portion You can see it start to list the variables at the bottom there. 
You should be able to get rid of any errors by doing this: if income ne . then do; income = log(income); income = int(income); end;
Is it still saying it's an invalid argument to the function log? If so, what's the value of income for those records?
Good call. It looks like I had 100 or so zeroes. Logging those caused the problem. Thanks for your help!
zeroes. Thanks. I still wonder why on earth it prints off every variable like that.
You're welcome. Glad it worked!
How do I use the output to troubleshoot. It only printed one value for income and it wasn't the problem.
You can always do a proc print on the data set. Or you can adjust the value for errors in an options statement: options errors=20; If it generated the "invalid argument" message and then showed the values for all of the variables, there was a problem with income (if it's still the log function that's causing the issue). Remember that your functions are overwriting the original income value. You might change the variable names to troubleshoot.
 * All visits for persons that went to B and another place; PROC SQL; SELECT PersonID, Place, Date FROM mydata WHERE PersonID IN (SELECT PersonID FROM mydata WHERE Place = 'B') AND PersonID IN (SELECT PersonID FROM mydata WHERE Place &lt;&gt; 'B'); QUIT; 
Thank you for your help! It oddly comes out as blank though....
So the dataset has 100 observations, which for variable x are populated 10 times? Are the 10 values evenly distributed? Even if they were, lag4 only looks back 4 observations, so you'd have some odd-looking results! Could you perhaps elaborate on the data and your requirements?
Oh, so x is populated from _N_ = 1 to 10? Honestly, without seeing your data, any of the solutions you've posited sound arbitrary. Why use lag at all? Just use retain if all you want to do is fill in rows 11 to 100. retain newx; newx = ifn(x ne .,x,newx*y); I'm not near SAS so that might not work perfectly. 
Fair enough. It's hard to work mostly blind :P Anyway, I'm glad you've got a solution that works.
Thank you! Feel free to pass this info on to anyone you know of that is interested! I'd appreciate any referrals. 
[SAS Office Analytics](http://support.sas.com/software/products/oa/index.html) (OA) is a collection of SAS products. The most prominent of these for the end user is Base SAS, Enterprise Guide, and the Office Addin. We rolled this out in our office (well EBI which is OA plus some). From my observation, EG does make SAS easier to use but at some point you are going to need to know Base SAS (coding). The office plugin allows you to pull in data and reports already created in SAS into Excel. You can't create a report in Excel and save it to SAS for example. Also, the version we are running (6.x) is pretty unstable. There is a new version available but we haven't tested it yet. This is a server based product and all your code runs on a central server. If you are maintaining it yourself, you need training to do it properly and it takes up a lot of time to get the permissions and data access setup correctly. 
It comes automatically in SAS?
I always use one.
also tried if startdate '09/01/15'D then term = "F15"; and it didn't work.
'01sep2015'd
Duhhhhhh. i swear i'm getting dumber every day. Thanks! Worked like a charm. :)
Finally working on the data again, googled the same question and came across my own post. Totally forgot I had posted this. Thanks! :)
What format are the files inside the zip archives? Can you provide a minimal, verifiable and complete example of a section from the code you ran that reproduces one of the errors? I suspect it's lots of similar ones rather than 100 different ones.
Just sum the amount grouping by account and category (using a data step or otherwise). Then proc sort by same grouping, but including amount. Then do a data step using by account category, with if first.category then output. Or just proc sql-fu and do it all in one query.
SAS is used by a variety of institutions for a variety of reasons. For example, the New York State Department of Health uses SAS for most of their analyses. There are often jobs posted that require basic proficiency but there are others that require more advanced proficiency. If you're interested in Biostatistics you should find out what software your local health department uses, specifically their epidemiology department(s) - though other areas may use it as well. When I say basic knowledge I mean, knowing how to merge data sets, run basic frequency statistics, and a good understanding of cleaning, tracking and manipulating data. When I say advanced, I mean using macros, running statistical analyses and creating programs that are run as part of others etc... A huge advantage that I see for you based on the fact that your self teaching is: the ability to use Google to solve/teach your self solutions to things you don't yet know. Can't stress how important this is. You can go to every SAS trading in the world but if you can't use Google to solve your problems on a daily basis then your gonna have huge issues. In regards to the learning curve, it definitely is there but if you have the basic concepts (what was required for my job a year ago) and you start a job working with them daily - as you improve on your code and really start to understand what you're doing you'll over come the learning curve pretty quickly. Eventually you'll get introduced to macros and feel like a thousand new doors have opened and it'll motivate you and substantially increase your mastery of SAS. After a year of working a job which required a basic knowledge of SAS (I had taken about 3-4 Biostatistics courses and data management courses in my MPH program) I would now cautiously place myself in the advanced category. Things that I didn't realize coming into the job were: I can ask my coworkers for help and they will help, Google is amazing, your bosses and coworkers are there to help you develop and will care enough to see you develop properly. 
It is hard to tell what will happen to SAS in 5-10 years. The industry is being shaken up by the popularity of R. However, I speculate that R will never full replace SAS because of R's open source nature. SAS is managed by a big company, provides a lot of support to their clients, and is relatively stable; These are things that governments and people working with the government like to see. I would recommend focusing on data manipulation, merging, and recording. Then work on macros and proc report. Regarding salary, SAS programming is a specialized skill, you should find a job that pays much much more than $15/hr.
Thank you, I'll look into that. Did you mainly learn SAS through school or as you were working in the field?
It is okay to learn R in parallel after getting some functional competency in SAS. I am not a fan of waiting till you master one language, because you might be waiting a really long time. 
I appreciate your response! &gt;If all other things are equal, then I will take the person who is better at SAS. For the hiring committees you've partaken in, what would you say are the main 2 deciding factors (aside from prior experience) in hiring somebody? The way you've worded it above implies that SAS knowledge may be lower down in importance. Yes, the Pharmacy Degree should I veer to Biostatistics.
Genuine question, what subfield of job postings are you looking at that never mention R? I'm a statistical programmer with a ton of experience with SAS, Stata, and R, and I almost never see job postings these days that don't mention R. It might not be their top-requested skill, but any company that knows what it's doing in the research field these days will mention R, and know that an R programmer could pick up another language if needed.
What drives your view that SAS is becoming more dependent on SQL?
For people who don't have full expertise in any technical skill I always tell them that for most research gigs, the ability to understand and conduct good research can go a long ways towards making up for any technical skill deficiency. I sometimes teach statistics to undergrads and I tell my students this as well. Your ability to understand how to use SAS is mostly influenced by your ability to understand statistics. That is, if you know what you want SAS to do and why, then learning how to do it is easy, because you just google what you want to do and there are step by step instructions. For entry level jobs that are just reporting or whatever, just knowing how to organize the data which is closer to SAS becomes more important. However, this is really a function of being able to show me that you understand how people use data to make decisions and that you understand that there are ways to present the data to said decision makers effectively. Anyways, to answer your question - the two factors are 1) demonstration of ability to understand the research process and the role that data plays in conducting research, and 2) technical skills (SAS, research methodology, statistics) and then 3) fit into office culture. But like I said, proficiency in 1 and 3 often make up for deficiencies in 2.
I can see the appeal from a LOC point of view - on the other hand, it can sometimes be rather hard to understand what a single complex SQL join is doing vs. a series of simpler data step merges. Also, although the number of opportunities to make mistakes is lower, the consequences can sometimes be worse - e.g. if you accidentally trigger a cartesian join, that might require O(mn) disk / time to process rather than O(m+n) for the data step merge. I suppose I'm in the (fortunate) minority, as most of the data I work with are already available to me as SAS datasets - in the wider case, though, I would tend to agree with you. I would definitely use SQL more in your scenario.
Ah, are you using enterprise guide? I've never used prompt-based SAS. I think most people here also fall into that boat. 
Oh my gosh, yes. It's a disaster. I work for a healthcare company and I feel like all their systems are out of date. 
I've given verbal SAS and Unix quizzes to applicants during interviews. I did it more to determine if the person was lying about their experience on their resume. The questions were very basic. I'd be surprised to see anything too difficult.
Yup. the whole path, which works in Explorer. I'm using a Windows host, so it's starting with (in my case) E:\
Sorry, I should have specified, this generates a separate table of week number and start and end dates, which you can merge with your data. You could also use it to build a format and apply that to week number in your main data.
I thought maybe that was the case. I've merged it back with my main data, but I'm a little stumped where to go from here. Logic along the lines of: "For the first date with positive sales within the 1-52 week range, enter relevant date, then for the last date with positive sales within the same range, enter the relevant end date". But implementing this in code is a bit of a stretch for me. I'm getting ready to break down and do this in Excel, but I'm supposed to be learning SAS, so that feels silly. Thanks very much for all your help so far. 
You, sir/madam, are a gentleman and a scholar. This creates start and end dates, but reduces my overall number of observations from ~24k to ~2.5k (presumably due to grouping). Would I then just merge the resulting dataset back onto the original data? Thanks again!
No problem! You've earned it. Ok, one issue. I've been able to remerge everything fine, but as I review my data I see that *all* start dates say 03Jan2015 and *all* end dates say 09Sep2015. This might be accurate for a single record, but not for all the records. Any suggestions? (An interesting aside: the help provided by /u/dingochutney gave me the exact same results, down to the duplication of the same start and end dates, even though the steps to achieve them were different.)
Argh, sorry. 
No, that's totally okay. I'm sorry... I was worried that any reply I would give to your question would sound 'snippy'. I really appreciate any and all effort to help. :)
Wow, thanks for the gold mate, that's shocked me a bit, I was happy to help (in my own scattershot way!). Ok, if you're looking to capture min and Max by sku, a small tweak is needed: proc SQL; create table minmax as select sku, min(start_date) as mindt , Max(end_date) as maxdt from mergedData Where sales &gt; 0 Group by sku; quit; Then re-merge onto your master set. You could do this as an inline view, keeping it as one step, and I'll post example code if you're interested, but this way is a little clearer. Sorry if I've misunderstood! Oh, and you may have already cracked it, I just woke up (UK here) :) 
Edit: Turns out it was an easy fix. I've solved it, now, but it wouldn't have been possible without your help, and the help of other users in this sub. You guys are the best. Feel free to see below if you want the gory details, and let me know if you have questions. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- There should be unique dates for each set of weekly sales observations. There are 451 total observations, each with sales records for the 52 weeks in the year. I transposed these for the sake of making the start and end variables, ending up with a dataset with 23,452 lines (451x52). So maybe I didn't give enough detail for the dataset... It looks more like this: SKU | Week_Ending | Sales | WeekNum ---|---|----|---- 12345 | 1/3/15 | 0 | 1 12345 | 1/10/15 | 2 | 2 12345 | 1/17/15 | 3 | 3 12345 | 1/24/15 | 1 | 4 12345 | ... | ... | ... 12345 | 12/17/15 | 0 | 51 12345 | 12/24/15 | 0 | 52 22346 | 1/3/15 | 0 | 1 22346 | 1/10/15 | 0 | 2 22346 | 1/17/15 | 1 | 3 22346 | 1/24/15 | 2 | 4 22346 | ... | ... | ... 22346 | 12/17/15 | 0 | 51 22346 | 12/24/15 | 0 | 52 With 451 total SKUs, each with 52 lines of observations related to sales. I want to generate Sales Start and Sales End dates for each of those 451 SKUs, or one set of start and end dates for each sequence of 1-52 on the WeekNum variable. My current code is this: Proc sql; create table WeeksT4Test as Select *, (min(week_end)-7) as Start_Date format date9., (max(week_end)) as End_Date format date9. from WeeksT2 where year(week_end + 7) = 2015 and year(week_end -7) = 2015 and sales &gt; 0; create table WeeksT4Test as select a.*, b.Sales_Start, b.Sales_End from WeeksT2 as a left join minmax as b on a.ContractNum = b.ContractNum and a.SKU = b.SKU and a.VarA = b.VarA .... and a.VarG = b.VarG; quit; There are a number of other variables that I'm matching on that I didn't include in the table, just because the variable names are sensitive and I didn't want to go through the effort of changing them etc. Plus it was just a lot to put in the table and I'm not sure it would have added anything to the discussion. These other variables are represented by VarA - VarG here, and were only necessary to ensure that I had pulled out each unique sales record (because SKU alone is not enough). Wherever you say "SKU" in your code examples, I've been using all of those variables. Thanks again! Edit: So it turns out that my mistake was this. In my code above, I select all variables from WeeksT2, where I should actually have been only selecting the variables that uniquely identify each record. Once I changed that, it works. Thanks for the help!
 &gt;Does specifying SKU in the select statement tell SAS that it should be looking for min and max values within each SKU? Yes, exactly. &gt;Then grouping at the end collapses records back onto SKUs? Correct! When you use an aggregate function in SQL (sum, min, Max, avg, etc.), any fields that are not in the function(s) are 'grouping' variables - the resulting dataset will contain one row per combination of grouping variables. So in your case, the first summary had no grouping variables so returned min and Max for the whole dataset (after filtering out non-sale weeks). The tweak to add sku changed the query's scope, to search within each distinct sku value for min and Max. It would work the same way if you add extra grouping variables (such as sales person, or area, etc). Always remember to include every grouping variable in the Group By - SAS SQL will not error if you don't (like almost all other databases would) but you'll see a message about 'remerging summary data' and get weird results. It's worth playing around with SQL summary functions, they can be easier to use than data step summaries in many cases.
Use Tableau 
There is a section on "Notes on Output Statistics" from The GLIMMIX Procedure that may help. It does provide a distinction between prediction and confidence limits http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/68162/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_glimmix_details79.htm
Yeah SAS isn't the best at creating appealing graphics without a lot of specific programming know-how. I think what everyone else is saying is that you should export your data and use something else to create the visualization that you want. Tableau, ARCGIS, and R all have native mapping abilities that are much better than SAS's.
SAS is 100% capable of creating gorgeous graphs, it's just a bit more difficult, and definitely not intuitive compared to most software. However, for producing lots of graphs, especially flexibly using macro code, SAS shines. You'll want to check out [Rob's Link(http://robslink.com/SAS/Home.htm) and explore. I've heard his books are great too, but I don't do a lot of data visualization in my job, so haven't picked them up yet. Also, the basic SAS website has helpful tips for the basics, like how to create a scatterplot. Lastly, remember, Google is your friend! For your particular problem, you may want to look into SAS's built in maps. The functionality to simply display lat and long coordinates is almost assuredly built in, though I don't know off the top of my head. 
thanks I will play around with GPLOT!
Excellent information :) Just clicked around that link, this is going to be a very big help, thank you!
Are you trying to assign the values 1 and 2 randomly?
This SAS communities article might be relevant for your analysis: [How to calculate geodesic distance in SAS](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/How-to-calculate-geodesic-distance-in-SAS/ta-p/241632). And PROC SGPLOT (now part of Base SAS) has more elegant syntax than GPLOT for creating analytical graphs. Here's an example that might be relevant: http://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2011/11/11/label-only-certain-observations-with-proc-sgplot.html. Lots more available on the SAS [Graphically Speaking blog](http://blogs.sas.com/content/graphicallyspeaking/).
If you look at combo #1 and combo #8, I'm essentially putting all 3 states in the same group, the only difference being that I'm calling it group 1 vs group 2. Similarly, combo #2 is the same as combo #7 since states 1 and 2 are grouped together and state 3 is by itself.
Nope! I'm trying to write out every combination.
You say you're using a thin client. Are we talking Citrix or SAS Studio? If SAS studio, are you sure that the E: drive on your machine is the same as the E: drive on the server? If possible, try a UNC path, something of the form \\server\share. If you have a mapped E: drive, then it'll say something like "share at server" in My Computer.
If the example you provided is true, could you not just drop the last 4 combos? Data new (keep=combo1--combo4); Set old; Run; 
Combo 2 is not the same as combo 7. They appear to be opposite.
Maybe creating a Cartesian product in PROC SQL by dynamically generating the tables to join repetitively with a macro. It sounds like you could just join the same table to itself repetitively.
This! This is what I'm looking for! Thank you so much.
This is the most SAS thing ever, to have an entire collection of really cool visualizations NOT on their own website, just hosted by some guy on the internet, and they make little effort to publicize it or provide similar demos of their own. I know that sounds bitter, but as someone who honestly tried to use SGPLOT but gave up in favor of finding simple and abundant examples of R/ggplot2 figures, it's crazy to see this.
as far as I remember color is 'black' should be without quotes. But it should throw errors on that. If you really want black/white, maybe you should choose a black/white device. It should get that hint I think.
My Econ degrees used SAS, Stata and R. In my corporate job we use SQL (!!!), SAS and R (my suggestion).
You can import your models from SAS/STAT packages or from Enterprise Miner. SAS provides [some good tutorials that can show you the techniques and what to expect](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/mdlmgrtut/68237/HTML/default/viewer.htm#titlepage.htm). The Scoring Accelerator takes your imported models and converts them to scoring files and functions that can be run inside the database (DB2, in your case). The [SAS documentation](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/indbug/68170/HTML/default/viewer.htm#p04u5ti64h1maxn1ge0l6lvag45x.htm) can provide more details on how that works.
Got a response already! Here's what [one of the SAS developers said](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-GRAPH-and-ODS-Graphics/Controlling-colors-with-multiple-JITTER-scatter-plots/m-p/245995#M8915). MARKERFILLATTRS should be use only when you want the outline of the marker to be different from the fill. In this case, you should just set the color on the MARKERATTRS, like this: markerattrs=(SYMBOL=circleFilled color=black) 
This paper talks about using SAS/AF Frames to create calendars (and other things): Using SAS/AF® to Create Applications for the Administrative Aspects of Data Management in Clinical Trials http://www8.sas.com/scholars/05/PREVIOUS/1999/pdf/088.pdf Hope that helps! If not, you can search for/post your question on the SAS Support Communities https://communities.sas.com/ Good luck!
Cool. Wasn't aware of that option 
So, if I'm understanding you correctly your data is currently one record per subject per arrest and you want it to be one record per subject with separate columns for each individual arrest? What if someone gets arrested multiple times for the same offense - do you want that captured in separate columns? Do you want each column from an arrest (BookingNumber | ArrestOffense | ConvictionOffense | SentencingDate | AdmissionsDt | ReleaseDt | ParoleElg) captured as its own column in the final table, or would you be ok with concatenating variables together? My concern is that if someone gets arrested 20 times, that's 144 columns (7 data columns for each arrest multiplied by 20 arrests, plus the name/inmate number columns) of data right there. Versus if you concatenate values together you'd be looking at 4+n columns where n=number of arrests. That make sense?
I think it would be fine, as long as all of the information is still there and the specific inmate identity and demographic information appears is listed only once. I too would be concerned about separate columns for each, as the data set contains 29 columns *as is*. And I actually just scrolled through the sheet again and found an individual taking up around 87 rows. There may be someone with more farther down the sheet (yup just found one with 103*). SO...given how ridiculously fluffy the set would be otherwise, I am all for concatenating.
OK cool. This shouldn't be too bad. I'll make this code somewhat generic, but the concept should take care of what you're after. [Pastebin link](http://pastebin.com/NA2GEuvB) I tried to comment it some a bit so you can see what does what. Hope this helps!
Stop using proc transpose and use the data step with retain statements and arrays. It'll make more sense to you as a progression towards a final result (instead of "repeat until it's right"), and also be MUCH more intuitive to another programmer who needs to read your code, if that's an issue to consider.
Like this? http://pastebin.com/99LgKWas You'd need to sort by everything in the "BY" statement before that data step. What that would accomplish is give you a comma-delimited list of concat_var values, grouped by inmate_and_demo_vars and arrest_id_var. ----- Alternatively, I think you might be talking about transposing concat_var so you account for multiple offences in columns grouped by inmate_and_demo_vars and arrest_id_var. In that case, just add arrest_id_var right to the BY statements (so, "by inmate_and_demo_vars arrest_id_var order_var;" everywhere that you see a BY statement), and change the line of "if first.[last variable from inmate_and_demo_vars] then recnum=0;" to "if first.arrest_id_var then recnum=0;". That make sense?
Google is your friend: http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/sas/modules/longtowide_data.htm This will compare the process to proc transpose: http://www.lexjansen.com/nesug/nesug12/ff/ff01.pdf
I did google but didn't come across those. Perhaps my search queries weren't quite right. Thank you.
I have a lot of down time at work. A LOT. And right now I get to do a lot of it at home, which means I get some peace and quiet. I've been looking at some tutorials and there are so many options that look solid. How do you suggest practice, if I don't get to use SAS in my job regularly? Are the practice exams from the SAS website a good tool?
As long as you have access to run programs, you can learn a lot by creating your own data sets or by using the SASHELP library. I would recommend things like running reports with PROCs, as well as sorting, merging, setting data sets together, and general data step programming, including outputting data sets and using KEEP=, DROP=, WHERE=, and RENAME= statements. This would include creating variables using IF/THEN logic and DO loops. It would also be great to practice using functions and formats, especially becoming familiar with SAS dates. Those are just some things off the top of my head to give you a good feel for the basics. After you master those things, you can try arrays and macro programming. A year should be plenty of time to build your skills if you have the time to devote to it. Good luck!
 Proc print data=your_data; Where 20000 &lt;= income &lt;= 30000 and sex = "male"; Var Desired_Variables; Run; 
To newbies, getting files into SAS is probably the hardest thing to figure out. It isn't like excel where you just double click and open a file. However, past that, it is pretty straight forward, a strong understanding of Boolean logic will take you far. The rest is just remembering the commands. My coworker, who is a financial analyst (Excel power user), passed the base SAS certification to flirt with his now wife. He just read a book on it, not sure he ever opened up the program.
thanks a lot. wow
I did. I passed the base cert exam in two months with the programming essentials video tutorial (free on sas website) and the base cert book. Im working on the advanced cert now. You can do it. I suggest trying to get it done in less time than more because the exam covers a lot of material that you're likely to forget as days weeks months pass. 
This is awesome to know. Thank you.
Just for the sake of sharing, you can also use "between" in where statements, like this: Proc print data=your_data; Where income between 20000 and 30000 and sex = "male"; Var Desired_Variables; Run; Also, I just realized that you might have issues with the 'sex = "male"' part because the where condition is case-sensitive. You may need to use the upcase function to ensure everything is handled correctly. For Example: Proc print data=your_data; Where income between 20000 and 30000 and upcase(sex) = "MALE"; Var Desired_Variables; Run; 
Scoring accelerator is a great tool for pushing the calculations downstream and into the database. Beware of using Code Nodes in Enterprise Miner though. They have to be integrated in the correct way in order to generate score code that can be used in the Scoring Accelerator. Since the Code Nodes are typically DS and Scoring Accelerator is DS2, there are some differences. If you are automatically triggering a retrain of the model in Model manager you have to make sure that the code nodes use the appropriate macro substitution variables. If you have problems I suggest contacting SAS Tech support. They generally are very friendly and know their stuff.
You can find a lot of great free study material on the SAS website too. Check out http://support.sas.com/training/tutorial/. You can also download SAS University Edition (http://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html) , which is a free version of SAS to use. It does not contain all modules, but is more than enough for a Base Certification. Good luck!
The sampsize option can cater for both. As soon as you select a number smaller than 1, it assumes it's percentage. So just state it as 0.2. 
See about halfway down: http://www.listendata.com/2014/10/cluster-analysis-using-sas.html?m=1
The biggest difference I've noticed in recent SAS vs. earlier is ODS: the graphics / making PDFs stuff looks different. You can take a quick look in the SAS/Stat sections of these: [What's new in SAS 9.4 document](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/whatsnew/64788/PDF/default/whatsnew.pdf) [What's new in SAS 9.3 document](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/whatsnew/64209/PDF/default/whatsnew.pdf)
It will almost definitely help you find an internship and even a full-time job after school, but if that sounds terribly boring to you, think hard about what that means. Is it boring because you find it too easy or the problem aren't interesting? If so, remember there's a huge world of analysis out there, and you can find the right place. Or is it because you want nothing to do with managing and analyzing data? If so, it's hard to justify learning SAS. You don't have to choose your life path today, but just give that some thought and see what comes out of it. Good luck! As a sophomore in college I had no idea I'd end up being a SAS programmer.
I am sure you will be able to handle it whatever the case
Thanks for the reply. Maybe it's just the teacher or the class, but it's completely uninteresting. I didn't mind SAS-I too much for the most part, but the SAS-II class seems completely boring. I'll tell you that I'm an actuarial science major. I was looking at SAS as kind of a backup plan if actuarial science didn't work out for me. The one teacher who recommended SAS said that there's one company who is always looking for SAS interns from our school. I think that point sold me. Is my motivation for taking SAS classes bad? I would only stay in SAS at this point for the internship and something to put on my resume to eventually help get a job as an actuary. I think it would be unlikely for me to get an internship this summer related to actuarial science. 
Ability to connect to use TLS authentication for email. Lets you use outlook365. That was a big deal for me. 
You would certainly be at an advantage to continue. Most places will train you if you don't already know it, but it will look very good on your resume.
No worries, I am the one asking for help. Thanks again for your assistance.
I graduated from pharmacy school in the mid 90s with a BS in Pharmacy. Worked couple years in hospital and retail and hated it..had to get out of pharmacy. Got a job in Data Management at a CRO and ended up getting 3 months of training in SAS (for pharma industry). 16+ years later I'm a Statistical Programmer in the Pharma industry (gave up my pharmacy license years ago). Having the pharmacy degree will help you with the clinical knowledge however it is not necessary. What would help most is getting an MS in statistics in conjunction with your pharmacy degree. THe job I do isn't really exciting however it's in more demand now where I live than pharmacists. I do contract work and work 100% from home. 40 hrs per week by the hour. No weekends or holidays. I don't have to deal with insurance or the public like a pharamcist. Best move I made for QUALITY OF LIFE even thought it's not that exciting. Getting that first internship or entry level job is most important. A CRO is where you will get the best experience. Now alot of companies are hiring SAS programmers to work from home but I would recommend you get a job in house for the first few years to build up your skills and your network. Some of the work is outsourced to India however i've seen it myself where the quality is poor and has to be redone many times. Most companies will have a combination of US team and an India team. If you can program efficiently and communicate clearly, then the job prospects are good. Understanding the clinical data is important...get a Stats degree and you will always be employable. I wished I did my MS in Statistics instead of Information Systems (useless in biostatistics). Unlike other programming languages, you will NOT need to learn a new statistical language. As SAS uprgrades its application, they develop new 'functions' or 'procs' that actually take something that required many lines of code and can now be done with a function/proc. 95% of your work can be done with a basic understanding of SAS language, SQL and macros. Knowing the new functions that come out with new releases will only help you do your work However there is so much to the language that you will never use everything available to you in Pharma.
Simple, use proc sql. It can use the same table as two virtual sources. Proc sql; Create table all_zip_distance as Select a.zip, b.zip, zipcitydistance(a.zip, b.zip) as distance from sashelp.zipcode as a, Sashelp.zipcode as b; Quit; This code actually creates that table and finds the distance between the zip codes as well. In SAS, never do in two steps things you can do in one, saves time and resources.
Ah that is simple, thank you so much! Plus I actually know SQL, I was so caught up in learning about data steps and complex procedures that I forgot what was right in front of me. 
Ah, missed the matrix part. You pretty much have all the information you need, but just in a slightly different table than you asked for. If you still need the matrix, I will give you a hint: proc transpose. Use it after this step to create the matrix with zip code as row and column and distances as the fields. Zip code by itself cannot be a column name, so you will have to use a prefix.
You Americans are really spoiled with the `zipcitydistance` function! I had to write a bunch of macro code to do the same thing with UK postcodes in the ancient version of SAS we use at my workplace...
Only thing left for you to do is to publish a paper and put the code out for people to use :) you may get a free ticket to sas conference! Unless you did it already! 
I'd probably just loop through the data by ID and use a RETAIN statement, something like this: proc sort data=mydata; by ID; run; data mydata2; set mydata; by ID; length bignote $ 3500; retain bignote; if first.ID then bignote=strip(note); else bignote=strip(bignote)||" ; "||strip(note); keep ID bignote; if last.ID then output; run;
I was in similar situation as you. 1. Don't run the code! You don't want to rewrite over anything. 2. Read through the code and view what output is already created without you running it. 3. Change the libname output to a different location 4. Read the code step by step and run each step one at at time. It'll take a while but it's the best way to learn and not screw up.
Definitely want to make sure you dont overwrite anything permanent. An option to help do that is to use: Options [NoReplace](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrdict/64316/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a000203031.htm) ; It keeps SAS from overwriting permanent data sets. 
you can cut and paste the data directly into excel from the tournament listings. You can use the import wizard to get the excel file into SAS. And SAS will print out the code for you, too. erase the country column and add a date column. keep the order of finish, if you want. Don't do it by hand. including the time to find the data, it was quick to get one tournament in. a few minutes per tournament, tops. there might be a better way to get it in, in larger chunks, if you can find the data Note that, if the import doesn't work from excel correctly, save the excel file as a csv file and import that. 
The other suggestion I received was to have 1 column for round (with r1, r2, r3, r4 as identifiers) and 1 column for score- would that make more sense?
As a general rule, certification is for chumps looking to pad their resumes. It works on dweebs who have no idea how to hire, so there is potentially a leg up, but if the course content doesn't actually add to your skills then skip it.
So important deal is the courses have to be relevant to the task at hand?
Oh! And I just saw your last question! I got certified from my University as well, back in 2011. I think it's kind of useless because they have no way of knowing what the University cert is or checking it. At least with the official SAS certs you can go into their database and check to see if they are indeed certified. 
Wut?
Why this does not work is easy. At the first record of the first subject you do two things: You fill ftempmin and output. You subsequently fill ftempmax at the last row of the first subject. Then you do first row of second subject, fill ftempmin and output. Hence the ftempmax of the first subject is displayed at the second subject. 
I'm an idiot. I didn't even notice that. I'll try that now and report back, thanks.
SAS is a tricky animal
Yes, she wanted us to use first and last.
For some reason when I first read the assignment I thought we had to output the first of each usubjid, but after rereading it I see that isn't the case. Whoops lol. 
You might take a look at the CATX function. Makes for cleaner code IMO than strip() and concatenate: bignote = catx(" ; ", bignote, note); It was added in v9 IIRC. See also CAT, CATS, and CATT. 
I'd use a proc format. A merge or proc sql would also work, but those are much less efficient.
I would guess the university has a single system and we are communicating with it though PuTTy. Interesting. Glad to know this isn't much different tho! Thanks for the feedback!
PROC SQL; Create Libref.dataset as Select Blahblahblah From Libref.otherdataset; Quit; If you are saving to the work library, these are being erased when you exit SAS. If you need them to be permanent then define another Libname on a shared or personal drive.
SAS through Putty is cheaper and allows you work with bigger datasets that can require more system resources than your computer can handle.
So, if I had to hazard a guess the "table" you're creating is being made within PROC SQL with a "select" statement, right? For example: proc sql; select a.person_id, a.fullname, b.age from person_info as a left join demographics as b on a.person_id=b.person_id ; quit; To then create a SAS dataset from that, just add one little line of code: proc sql; create table libname.dataset as /* &lt;--- ADD THIS */ select a.person_id, a.fullname, b.age from person_info as a left join demographics as b on a.person_id=b.person_id ; quit; That make sense?
Thank you. 
Morpheus meme: What if I told you, the table IS a data set? I mean, if you want a permanent data set you would just need to reference a permanent data set when you're making the table. Meaning referencing a libname and not the work folder. 
Ahh that makes sense. Our professor said that the course will focus a lot on database management. 
Job listings that don't post salary...
That's okay, it's in the frozen tundra. There hasn't been enough money printed.
If you create separate variables won't you just be back to square one, in that you still need to run multiple proc freqs?
I want to allow a record to be in multiple categories. 
Okay, then creating multiple variables is the best way. Or you could create proc formats with the existing variables for maximum efficiency.
Another option would be to use multilabel formats. To start with, you need one variable that has a different value for every possible type of record, but then you can assign each type to multiple formatted values, and each row will count towards all of those totals within `proc summary` when you use the `mlf` option.
Id do this with a macro combined with dictionary tables...this way if the source data set changes in any way in theory you can automatically update the contents of your final analysis data store I do this for a process at work where i gather statistics on approx 120 db2 tables to see how many rows are in there today versus yesterday Important to clean this up with proc datasets (remember the save / kill command depending on which is the shorter list) to keep my library clean 
I use SAS for a living. Do you have base SAS or sas Enterprise Guide at your disposal? I'd be happy to help you. Post some problems/questions and I'll see what I can do for you. It would also help to know what knowledge you have gained in your guessing/light research. 
If you submit this code, you can determine if you are able to use SAS/ETS, which apparently is required for PROC COUNTREG: PROC SETINIT; RUN; The output will be in the SAS log.
I've just run this code and it's come up with information about the current version, expiration dates etc...what exactly am I looking for? Thanks!
I know nothing about genmod... I tried to install SAS 9.30 but I need a SID file... which I don't have. And as I am a student at a university where this is not used nor does my dissertation supervisor have ANY idea how to use this software I am at a loss! Any other ideas? I will dive deeper into genmod to see if it is something I could use however proc countreg is really something I need!
You have to define what exactly you want from table 2; e.g. one or a combination of: (1) the mean height weight across all measures per person (2) the last height weight (3) the difference between the first height weight and last (4) every height weight measure in separate fields (5) the number of height weight measures Probably PROC TRANSPOSE for (4), the others should be possible using GROUP BY and summary commands (MIN, MAX, MEAN) in SQL.
I believe it would need to list SAS/ETS in the list of products. If it's not there, you may not have access to that proc. I'm not a stats expert, so I unfortunately don't know about alternatives. I'm sorry I can't be more help.
I/O is often the slowest thing in programs, so to make a program more efficient it's usually a good idea to reduce I/O. Don't read data more than once, and don't read what you don't need to read. wklink's advice is good.
Thank you!
If you could help, that would be great! I'm more of a stats person, SAS programming and macros are still kind of new to me! 
Yep this is it. Broken out into individual lines for readability :) Data Ihatesas; Set seriouslyusepython; Array foo (10) jobSat:; Array bar (10) bar1-bar10; Do i=1 to dim (foo); /* your if logic applied to foo {1} and written to bar {1} */ End; Run; 
You can also consider using proc format method as well. 
Ten tests, let's say there's a binary field called benchmark_flag that's 1 or 0 depending if it hit. The easiest way to do this would be something like creating a data set with all the tests that meet the benchmark(s) and then merge that with your original set. proc sql; create table benched as select test_name from original_data group by test_name having max(benchmark) = 1; quit; Then join that to the original data. 
both solved the problem of identifying the appropriate tests, which is a big step. But I am not sure how the merge/join works to get the benchmark tests to appear for the individual person, since not all of the people meet each of the benchmarks. what I need is for tests where bench=1 to bring up all of the dates where that test was taken for an individual -but not for the whole cohort. I feel like I am imposing too much, but this may be the tougher question for me to frame correctly. 
I suspect that a combination of the [strip()](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrdict/64316/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a002295689.htm) and [compress()](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrdict/64316/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a000212246.htm) functions would work well for this application. For example, let's say you want to remove all commas, leading/ending spaces, and #'s... that would be strip(compress(name_string,"#,")). If you end up with multiple spaces in the middle of the string and want to condense those down to one, then the [compbl() function](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrdict/64316/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a000214211.htm) works great for that also. So as an example... proc sql; create table demographic_info as select person_id, strip(compbl(compress(full_name,"#,"))) as new_name from demographic_base_data ; quit; That help?
I'm curious about the problem but not curious enough to register. 
Sure thing! Glad it worked like you needed.
Its free to register, so just do it. Maybe you want to collaborate? I'm in the middle of putting together a Machine Learning Course, and have some background with multiple models. Might just do it for kicks
I don't even know if I would be any help. Which is why I would like to know the problem. I don't want to give my contact info away to some foreign challenge that I know nothing about and don't even know if it would be productive for me.
You can use proc SQL in SAS, but those are not SAS terms. [This should clarify SQL joins]( http://www.bhaumikpatel.com/2012/10/venn-diagram-visual-representation-of_7.html) You can do all this in Base SAS as well, it just depends what you're comfortable with. 
This is more of a SQL thing, [this] (http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/33052/Visual-Representation-of-SQL-Joins) should help.
* FROM &lt;A&gt; INNER JOIN &lt;B&gt;- keep only records that are in both data sets &lt;A&gt; and &lt;B&gt; * FROM &lt;A&gt; LEFT JOIN &lt;B&gt; - keep all record from &lt;A&gt; regardless of whether a match is found in &lt;B&gt; or not. * FROM &lt;A&gt; RIGHT JOIN &lt;B&gt; - keep all record from &lt;B&gt; regardless of whether a match is found in &lt;A&gt; or not. 
I usually use the reference category 0=white, however this arbitrary. You can use anything as the reference as long as you state that in your interpretation. Also, are you doing survival analysis? If so, you can use the strata statement to get the various hazard/survival rates
A few years ago when I did my Base certification the fee was 25 USD (through University). I don't think SAS makes a lot of money out of that. I can imagine that the primary cause for getting students SAS Certified is to make sure there are enough people who can work with SAS and the talent gap is not too large. SAS is still the most sought after skill for data scientists in companies (source: http://r4stats.com/2013/08/07/trends-in-the-analytics-job-market/)
That article is 3 years old.
To get the first observation in the data set, you'll use (obs=1) after the data set name in the set statement. For the last observation, use the notation "end=eof" (without the quotes) at the end of the set statement. Then do this: if eof then first = scan(name, 1, '!?.');
The first of each instance or literally just the first row? If it's just the first row then use the _n_ function. Pretty straight forward. All of these other solutions are overly complicated or wrong. if (underscore)N(underscore) = 1 then [do something]; reddit does not want me to underscore the N... _ N _ without the spaces.
Are the variables *formatted* to only show one character or do they have a *length* of 1? In order to change the length, you have to assign the length prior to setting the data set using a length statement. You'll have to explicitly list the character variable names though. There are ways to automate this, but I don't know how much experience you have with that. I can provide more info if you need to go that route. If the format is simply $1. but the length is more than 1, you can just change the format using a format statement. Separately, do you realize that _N_ is an automatic variable? [You can name your variable the same thing, but it isn't recommended.](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrcon/62955/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a000998953.htm) Edit: there are other approaches, such as leaving everything as it is and simply creating a format that prints "NA" for the data selected. But I don't know what you actually need to accomplish. For numeric variables, formats and special missings are useful in these situations. 
Could you please provide input 2 datasets. And the expected output dataset. Also provide code you've currently used. It'll speed things up. 
sorry about that. below are the two sample data sets and what the final output should look like. as far as current code, i'm trying to clean up what i previously did, as i believe the updates i made after i referenced another site only made it worse, ha. ill send shortly. data hash_keys; /*hash table*/ length key $10 value $1; value = 'Y'; input key; datalines; 1234 54321 2345678909 ; run; data data_set; /*target table*/ length number $10; input number ; datalines; 1234567890 1234098765 0987654321 5432112345 2345678909 ; run; data final_result; /*end result*/ length number $10 value $1; infile datalines dsd dlm='|'; input number value; datalines; 1234567890 | Y 1234098765 | Y 0987654321 | N 5432112345 | Y 2345678909 | Y run;
I'm looking into it now. But do you have to do it with hash only? 
Please Move the end; of eof1 just before the stop; statement. Good luck !!!
thanks! I'm still thinking thinking of ways to do this with hash. I'll post my work soon, have a couple ideas 
thanks again for your help, I like the alternative approach. I'll keep digging away at this hash
Yeah, impossible. I'll message you if I get any bright ideas, but I tried a number of different approaches and couldn't get it to work. 
thanks again for looking! I created a work around, I'll share once I'm done if you're interested. 
Absolutely
There isn't a practice exam available, however this link may be helpful as it provides recommended training, sample questions, videos, etc.: http://support.sas.com/certify/creds/va.html#s1=2 Hope this helps! And good luck! 
can't do it
SAS jobs pay very well and they are always available. Being an actuary with solid SAS skills would be excellent.
maybe with small data.
If you're trying to do something like SELECT old.* format=WhateverFormat. then you're out of luck there. If you have a huge number of rows to format though I find that pasting the column names into Excel and using formulas to produce my SQL formatting really speeds things up. e.g. A B 1 col1 ="old." &amp; A1 &amp; " format " &amp; A1 &amp; "., " 2 col2 ... 3 col3 ... 4 ... to produce old.col1 format col1., old.col2 format col2., old.col3 format col3., You can always use SAS Macros but that might be a little overkill for this problem.
If your formats are in a data set (or maybe the easiest way forward is to make a data set), then you can use the CNTLIN function... http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/forum2007/068-2007.pdf 
Do you need a matrix of 50x50 though? Would a list be sufficient? Proc sql; Create table price_diff as A.item_name,B.item_name,(A.price-B.price) as price_diff From price_list A, price_list B; Quit; This will create a table with 50*50 rows with price difference between all the items. I can do the matrix, but sleepy right now!
What kind of files? What are you doing with the files?
If they have SAS/CONNECT installed, it shouldn't be too difficult as long as you're willing to give them update access.
As long as it is a sas dataset and you are in a Windows environment there is a way to use an ODBC connect statement in PROC SQL. You can use that to write directly to a SQL server instance, plus do a bunch of cool shit like execute stored procedures. Basically, when you use this method, you are making SQL do all the heavy work then pipe the results in, versus piping the data in and making SAS do the work. This can be advantageous with significantly large datasets, depending on the task. I forget the precise syntax for the statement, and it can be finicky, but once you get it figured out for your environment it can be quite useful. You can also use a libname statement, which will also use an ODBC method, but which looks quite different from the PROC SQL method, and which does not have the capability of executing stored procedures.
I'm so dumb I'm subtracting rows it's all in the same column 
This is the correct answer. Doing this without SQL sucks. *Sort your 30 million records; Proc Sort data=YourData; By DateVar; Run; *Sort your 30 million records into the 3 most recent dates and output to a new dataset DESCENDING; Proc Sort data=YourData out=DateData (keep=DateVar) nodupkey; By descending DateVar; run; *Resort your 3 records ASCENDING; Proc Sort data=DateData; By DateVar; Run; *Merge with your sorted 30 million records; Data Final; Merge YourData (in=a) DateData (in=b); By DateVar; If B; Run;
The basics are covered in the Base SAS Certification program. By no means does this make you a good SAS programmer, but you will be able to evidence you can learn some basic rules and pass a test on that material. http://support.sas.com/certify/creds/bp.html Book is about £80 and exam around £150 I recall. Experience is best. Get a download of University Edition for your home PC and mess around with some of your own data. http://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html 
Proc transpose data= din out= items prefix=item; By id_var; Var item; Run; Data final; set items; %macro diff; %do j=1 %to 50; %do I=1 %to 50; Diff&amp;i.&amp;j. = item&amp;i. - item&amp;j. ; %end; %end; %mend; %diff; Run; 
You can get older editions for a lower price on amazon. It should be good enough for certification.
You'll get a free PDF if you google it. Good luck!!
You could likely get an analyst position without much SAS experience and learn on the job. If you have the analytical skills or a degree, learning SAS shouldn't be too big of a deal.
What are these "books" you speak of :)
SAS makes a prep guide to get certified, don't waste your time elsewhere.
SAS official website has a free course on Programming Essentials I (Half part of BASE SAS). You can get the books online if you just Google. The syllabus is easy to understand if you have programming background. You can register for the certification exams on Person Vue. If you need more information, PM me anytime.
http://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html SAS University edition will help you wrap your head around the basics, but you cannot do a lot of higher level statistical analyses with it. BASE SAS is mostly just data manipulation/cleaning/management. You need SAS/STAT for more advanced analytical tools. 
I am thinking of writing a program that converts R code into SAS code. or SAS into R code. Not sure which one would be better. Most contract jobs require SAS coding , I teach R research methods . So if I could write a program that converts R to basic SAS , I could take on some of those contracts
You can use the online version of SAS. id.oda.sas.com/SASLogon/logout?_sasapp=SAS+Studio+Mid-Tier+3.4 It is free to use
Background - i have an economics degree, good maths skills etc. 
Yes you can. Good luck!!! All you need is the pdf available in Google search. You can finish 5 chapters a day. 
what pdf is this sorry? thank you
Any sas background?
&gt; base sas certification prep guide pdf. thanks!
I've got the latest prep book now, will book the exam for end of April. Thanks for your input. 
Have you tried performing a "left" on it? Maybe there's a leading character. Also, you could try to substr it one position at a time to determine what's in each position.
Need actual code. You have a comma after y=1. Try creating a variable with the first three chars of X then list proc freq that
Have you tried using INDEX? if index(x,"Elective") &gt; 1 then y =1; else y=0;
Can you do a proc print on the table and see what it actually contains? Maybe you have done it already.
is there a big difference between base and advanced? 
Thanks, appreciate your input :) think i will set myself between 4-6 weeks for BASE. 
I'd look at all of the positions in the field one by one to see what *is* in each position. For example, pos1 = substr(x, 1, 1); pos2 = substr(x, 2, 1); and etc. If some positions are still unclear, you can even do asciinum = rank(substr(x, 1, 1)); That will give you the ASCII sequence number of that position in the variable. There is a key here: http://www.theasciicode.com.ar/ascii-control-characters/escape-ascii-code-27.html.
I think there was a case problem. I never tried to resolve it I just used a work around 
If upcase(strip(x))=:'E' then y=1; If this doesn't work, then the issue is with csv import or some other part of the code. 
The VA Fast Track course is pretty much your best bet. I took the course in October, but haven't had any time to try this certification yet. A few guys I know that are long-time SAS users just recently passed this last week and each of them said it was very challenging; one of them had already failed it before. Short of taking the course, you need to have an understanding of how to build interactive reports with hierarchies/filters/info Windows/etc. As far as explorations, you really should be able to use and understand each one, and demonstrate changing variable type, creating aggregates and calculations within the data pane, and using the various property options on the right pane.
Sure, post the code here and what you're trying to do.
You can have just one dataset of flights, and use a cartesian product on itself. (Two SET statements, you'll see below.) This gives all possible combinations of flight 1 and flight 2, and you just keep the ones you want with an IF ... THEN OUTPUT statement. Like this: Data flights; input flightnum departcity :$100. arrivecity :$100. departtime :Time. arrivetime :Time.; format departtime arrivetime time.; datalines; 747 RALEIGH ATLANTA 7:20 8:30 534 ATLANTA TAMPA 9:30 10:30 149 TAMPA CHICAGO 12:00 13:30 361 RALEIGH CHICAGO 10:00 11:10 597 CHICAGO TAMPA 9:30 10:45 366 CHICAGO RALEIGH 14:30 16:00 199 TAMPA ATLANTA 13:00 14:00 305 ATLANTA CINCINNATI 10:00 11:00 921 CINCINNATI TAMPA 12:30 14:00 654 CHICAGO CINCINNATI 15:00 16:00 ; Run; data total_flight; set flights (rename=(flightnum=flightnum1 departcity=departcity1 arrivecity=arrivecity1 departtime=departtime1 arrivetime=arrivetime1)); do i=1 to n; set flights (rename=(flightnum=flightnum2 departcity=departcity2 arrivecity=arrivecity2 departtime=departtime2 arrivetime=arrivetime2)) nobs=n point=i; if (arrivecity1 = departcity2) and (arrivetime1 LE departtime2) then output; end; run; proc print data=total_flight; label flightnum1="Leg 1 Flight #"; /* etc. label the other variables */ run; Now, these cartesian products can be costly (in terms of processing time) if you have a very large N, but if you're just doing something on the order of hundreds of flights, it's probably OK. I'm not sure macros are actually needed here, unless you want to do something like an arbitrary number of links. Then you'd want to loop this. EDIT 1: I did run your program, and it had some duplicates in the results. (Obs 2 and Obs 4 are the same, for instance.) The method above should avoid this. EDIT 2: I didn't calculate layover, but that's just = departtime2-arrivetime1.
Yup. SAS just won't work after the real expiration. Take your expiration date, add 30 days for grace, add 30 days for warning and that is when it will not work. The logs will start showing stuff about being in a warning period if you are already there, then after the real expiration they will start showing license expired errors.
Update: I just had it confirmed by SAS support that this period is included with our license.
Sounds like you already figured it out, but the end of the 30-day grace period is the official "crash date" where you are no longer able to use your SAS products. 
You could rename var6 in the merge statement on each respective data set (in a rename= statement in parentheses). I assume that you also know that the syntax is "in=inA" and so on. I would leave out the length statement, as var10 will be a one-byte character field by default. If you don't want to bring in records with missing key variables at all, use a "where=" statement on each incoming dara set. You should be able to do everything that you want to do in one data step.
A slightly less verbose way of doing the missing check: where not(missing(coalescec(of var1-var5))); This assumes that the 5 key variables are literally named var1-var5. If not, you can declare an array, or move them into consecutive order using an informat statement before the merge statement so that you can use a double dash list.
Thank you very much!! Wow, everything is in one data step! I will be testing this code today and I will let you know how it went. 
I have tested this with different test data. Above code works perfectly! Thank you very much for your help!! 
You're welcome, happy to help. 
Sorry, I didn't think that through - try `where cmiss(of var1-var5)=0;`.
Yeah the function works. Again, I had an issue using (of v1-v5). Do you have this issue in your SAS when using where statement along with function (of v1-v2) ?
Apparently this is [by design](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrcon/68089/HTML/default/viewer.htm#p0wphcpsfgx6o7n1sjtqzizp1n39.htm): &gt; The OF syntax is permitted in some SAS functions, but it cannot be used when using those functions that are specified in a WHERE clause. I'm guessing that this doesn't work because it depends on PDV stuff but where clause processing takes place before each observation is loaded into the PDV. I suspect that most of the time an equivalent `if` statement will peform almost equally well, if you're reading whole datasets anyway.
That does make more sense. Thanks a lot for looking into it. 
"frequency.lis" is just a frequency report/listing file where all frequency will be placed as a report, so that's not a SAS dataset. Here is my original code example where I was created "frequency.lis" report: &amp;nbsp; /* Creating Frequencies and directing report to Frequency.lis file*/ &amp;nbsp; proc freq data=dir1.output3; &amp;nbsp; tables var10 / missing out=dir1.frequency.lis; &amp;nbsp; title 'Frequency of Var10'; &amp;nbsp; run; &amp;nbsp; proc freq data=dir1.output3; &amp;nbsp; tables var6data1var6data2var6data3 / missing out=dir1.frequency.lis; &amp;nbsp; title 'var6 Comparison'; &amp;nbsp; run;
Do you foresee needing to use PROC SQL? I'd say the advanced cert really covers SQL, but doesn't really get into macros. It covers more advanced techniques like hash tables and I/O. There is a macro programming training if you're interested in macros. SAS offers a ton of specific trainings that might be more helpful if you don't foresee doing any macros or SQL soon. On a side note, I know you didn't ask, but if you've never done SQL or Macros, I'd be curious to know why you think the base SAS certification wouldn't be productive. You could get the prep guide (book) and complete the certification fairly easily if you have a lot of experience. I'm sure you'd learn a couple things or at the very least really solidify your knowledge. It also wouldn't cost much of your total budget. 
sample would be good as your description is very hard to understand.. I think you might be after Retain!
SAS creates data sets one observation (row) at a time. So, I'm not sure what you mean by SAS creating an entire column at a time. If you need to jump around the data a lot, it might be easier to do it all in an array and then output the data to the dataset once you've ironed out all the calculations. 
I see. Well, the advanced cert definitely covers PROC SQL. I'm not sure how far that gets you in real world SQL though. It certainly doesn't cover admin type stuff. 
I dont see myself ever needing to use admin type stuff. just query. the queries would be a bit tough though. i'd have to use a dozen tables for some of the simple queries
Use a retain statement in the data step. This will cause values in a column to be carried down. Just create two extra place holder columns to carry the information down, then do your calculations from that and drop the extra columns at the end.
If your SQL is really 6/10, that means you know enough to get started and know what to Google when you get stuck. Macro language 1 could be very interesting for you, as it will open up your world and introduce you to concepts you never even knew existed. Advanced certification is helpful as well for the reasons above. Are you a data analyst/data scientist? You mention advanced stats, I guess that means SAS/STAT. If you are, drop everything and learn SAS Enterprise Miner instead. Modelling in SAS Enterprise Miner is a huge win of time and performance. You don't have to know SAS programming for building predictive models and data mining with EM. However, you still do for preparing your data for analysis.
I just checked. Yes, it is ".lis" extension. I will run everything on Monday morning and try to test with different labels and formats and see what I get. Thank you very much for all your time and for all your suggestions!! Have a good weekend! :)
SAS Enterprise Miner is for predictive modelling and data mining only. For accessing, exploring and preparing data you are better of using SAS Base (in any of the IDE's: SAS Display Manager, SAS Studio or SAS Enterprise Guide). Accessing your databases is actually pretty easy once you know PROC SQL. Depending on the type of database, PROC SQL code is automatically transformed into the right SQL format for your database and executed in your database, rather than on your laptop or computer. If your tables are really **fully** ready for analytics in the database (which in my experience they almost _never_ are), you can connect SAS Enterprise Miner to them directly.
Thanks for the response, do you have documentation that I can review where it says that SAS goes row by row instead of column by column? In the data step, it seems that it would run the code as it sees it, and my undesired results seem to point towards the data step going column by column. 
You can use file and filename statement. Good luck!! You really need to go through the website link I had sent earlier before posting the next question. 
Thanks for the push, I got it to work. :)
You can create a a sas dataset from proc sql as follows: proc sql; create table your_dataset as select ... from imported_dataset; quit;
Proc sql noprint; select sum(var_y) into: sum_y from excel_import; Quit; Data din1; Set excel_import; Sum_y=&amp;sum_y.; Run; 
Oh, there's maybe a dozen easy to follow white papers on sending emails through the data step-- Google "sas email", I'm certain the first 2 or 3 white papers to show up are what I've used before. It's really just a few lines of code. The technical stuff, I think, is when your organization has some sort of security on the domain that blocks this sort of thing from easily occuring. I'd recommend testing the code off network at home with something easy like a Gmail account first for proof of concept and then trying it in the office. (What about PROC IML or learning how to call R code from SAS and then learning R?)
You could probably teach yourself some macro operations from white papers, but people do some really clever stuff with macros-- I could imagine coursework and overview as being useful.
That move out of pharmacy is looking better every year as schools grow. How'd you get SAS training in data management? Isn't that just making sure all the numbers are formatted correctly for the stats folks? 
i went to a 3 month training program in philadelphia specifically for SAS programming in the pharma industry. then had to do a 3 month internship at the company i worked for (a CRO) .....got 1 more year experience and then left for big pharma for a hefty pay bump 
I'm not sure exactly what you want to do. But you can output a format catalog to a dataset using cntlout= and then output that dataset to an excel spreadsheet using proc export. 
So you want your subjectID/age/gender column to appear on all pages? In your report you'd want to add an ID option in your DEFINE statements. DEFINE variableName / ID;
Come back to this thread when you've had a go! 
so It turns out that I had forgotten about a page break that isn't printed but is counted as a column. is there a version of the syntax where the id only works on the subject column? or do I have to look for a different way to do it? thanks again for you help!
Trying adding the ORDER option to the DEFINE statement. That should show at the top of the second page? PROC REPORT options are annoying haha
You can try adding option group/order, Id and page in the define statement. Play with these and see if it works. If you know how many lines you want to print per page, you can create a numerical order variable as a counter that can have noprint option for its define statement. Data final; Retain pagen line; Set din; If _n_=1 then do;pagen =1;line=1;end; Else line=line+1; If line=10 then do; pagen=pagen+1; line=0;end; Run; Proc report..... ; ...... Define pagen / order noprint; Define line / order noprint; .......... Break by pagen; Run; 
From your initial post it seems it adds another page because of the lenght of the column, but from the comment above it seems that the columns are too wide and thus your last column or two are on a new page? If it's the latter you can try to manually set the width of the columns or even the font size (Don't know the syntax off by heart, can check tomorrow at the office if it is indeed this), you can also just set the page layout to landscape (This seems too simple though)
Hey there! My name is Mike and I teach people how to use SAS on YouTube. I actually made a video that answers exactly this question. Just go to YouTube and search "Mikes SAS tutorials" and the macro video is titled special lesson 4 macro programming.
from what Ive read you don't seem to know much about Base SAS programming. First of all, you can't get the Advanced SAS Certification without the Base SAS Certification. Whatever certification you got from your local university doesn't mean much because it's not from the SAS Institute. 3k won't go very far with SAS Institute training, because the courses are pretty expensive. They are great, but cost a lot. SAS offers a an online review course that will prep you for the Base certification exam and it costs $1,100 : https://support.sas.com/edu/schedules.html?id=58&amp;ctry=US Once you have the base cert, you can start on the Advanced certification prep by taking the course on PROC SQL, which is $1300: https://support.sas.com/edu/schedules.html?id=2579&amp;ctry=US you said your sql is 6/10, but is that ANSI standard SQL, or PROC SQL? PROC SQL does some important things that regular SQL doesn't. that pretty much eats up your 3k for the year, so the following calendar year you can take the Macro Language course, which is $1300. https://support.sas.com/edu/schedules.html?id=2579&amp;ctry=US and then you would need the Programming 3 course which is $1950 https://support.sas.com/edu/schedules.html?id=1917&amp;ctry=US That would put you over budget, but not by much, you could just pay the rest yourself.
The resources said on this page here are all really good, However the complex macros you are thinking about can best be described as a lot of Cut and Paste. If you find that you are using SAS to cut and Paste while changing one value you'll see that Macros can be beneficial here. If you don't do a lot of cut and paste or re-use of code then Macros may not be really useful for you. 
Thanks! I'll definitely check it out and subscribe.
As most every teaching method mentions, Macros are just text substitution, albiet a bit complicated
I think that I found the answer: spanrows statement in the proc report. Don't know if syntax matters much, but I put it right after the data=dataset. thanks everyone for helping. 
 mikes ass tutorials?
No need. The parameter is the weight for the condition coded as '1' 
Yeah, I demonstrate how to twerk with statistics ;)
you should try it in R ;), way easier
I've done quite a few SAS / R / Matlab stats for https://www.freelancer.com/ . Not worth the effort. Great for quick jobs . No long term contracts yet.
Look into proc template and proc sgplot. You'll have more control. 
I'm hoping to avoid reworking 24 graphs by trying a new procedure, since I want them all to look consistent. :/
Nevermind, figured it out: n(of col:);
No problem. Feel free to shoot a PM if you ever have specific questions. I don't think this sub is very active. 
Ffs why is this nearly 500 pages? 
The clearest path is to get SAS certifications. Learning some basic statistical concepts would also be helpful as well. Generally, SAS certifications get you a very specific SAS programming job, focused more on programming and data management, less on analysis.
I didn't try command line actually. Will try and report back. It could very well be an OS issue - Windows XP where I work! Thanks for the response mate.
Check out SAS University Edition, its free
Thanks that makes sense, I knew about adding characters that you want to keep between the quotes in the 2nd argument but was puzzled because I didn't put a space in between the quotes and yet the spaces were still kept. I guess if I don't want the spaces then I'll leave the 2nd argument empty with no quotes at all.
Hey, thanks for asking. I think it went really well. I felt like I reviewed way more than was necessary for the interview, since it seemed like gauging your personality was somewhat more important. Sure, it was a major plus to show them what I knew (and the tip above helped, thanks again), but my impression now is they are willing to take people with no experience with SAS and train them from the ground up. My teacher for my SAS-II class works for the company, and she said that 12 people applied, and they are hiring 8. Knowing that, and knowing that you don't necessarily need any SAS experience to acquire the internship, I would feel pretty bad if I didn't get one of the eight spots.

Here I have used ODS to trace and select the table that we are looking for in our output. Then I made a hatchet job of joining those tables together and formatting them the way you wanted, sorry really tired.... But this should work and give you the following table in work.final: cancer |SMR_ct1| CI_ct1| SMR_ct2 |CI_ct2 ---|---|---|---|--- Colon |1.8221742329| 0.9293252654 |1.7082883433| 0.8437910479 Liver |2.2777177911 |1.2794822986 |2.3916036807| 1.3687166862 I think the only think you will need to change is all references to reddit.practice to work.cancer :) Thanks, that was good practice. 
No problem, ODS stands for output delivery system, it allows you to do some cool things with controlling how your data is outputted and it allows you to capture and change the output of certain proc statements. first run your original proc stdrate with `ODS TRACE ON;` written above it (this a global option, so generally you ought to turn it off as soon as your'e finished) So put `ODS TRACE OFF;` at the end. This will show you the tables you are creating and sending to the results tab in the log . the next statement `ODS SELECT Stdrate.Smr;` tells SAS to only create and open that one table. If you run your `PROC STDRATE` with that option on you should only see one table in the results tab. Again global so put `ODS SELECT ALL;` at the end Finally `ODS OUTPUT Stdrate.Smr = &lt;*dataset name*&gt;` tells SAS to take that table that you have identified as "Stdrate.Smr" and save it as the name the you specify. Then close at the end `ODS _ALL_ CLOSE;` So run each of those three statements one at a time and look at the log and the results tab, that should help you understand the process. Also I am not proud with the stuff at the bottom, but I got a bit stuck on doing it neatly and went for a quick win. So I wouldn't necessarily run with that part of the code. Also when you say larger data set, do you mean more columns i.e. ct3, ct4, ct5? or more rows? *also for getting the upper and lower limit of confidence you could try: data finala (keep=SMR CI tabname ); set colon1 colon2 liver1 liver2 indsname=dsn ; SMR = smr; CI = smrlcl||"-"||smrUcl; /*Lower - Upper*/ tabname = scan(dsn, 2,"."); run; Just concatenate the lower (smrlcl) and the upper (smrUcl) together 
Yeah, will output work by default and you can specify another libname if you wish, like all datasets (e.g. libname.dataset ) so you should have access to all the tables that you create. And you'll also have a few more tricks up your sleeve to manipulate the data after learning all this. if you have that many it might be simpler to learn to use macros and loops. Instead of copy and pasting everything. If I get a chance and it would be helpful I could write up an example for you. *Also I don't imagine having more strata will have any noticeable impact on the code written or the processing time, as this data is already quite aggregated, unless you want to separate the data by every combination of race/gender.... 
I don't think that is even a thing...
Sorry... guess I wasn't clear before. Sorry about that! Revised response: I've heard of that in other programs, but never in SAS. :/
I'm not aware of any tool within SAS that will let you do this directly. Try converting your pixel data to csv or a fixed-width format and then read it in to SAS with a data step.
Thanks again. I think I'm going to skip learning the macros for the sake of time, but I'm getting an error after the proc stdrate statement saying "The observation values for the TOTAL= variable in the POPULATION statement must be positive." What does this mean, is it because of a 0 population in one of my strata?
I don't understand the inner workings of the procedure to be certain, but try it on one strata with a 0 population
Nvm i figured it out. I can't have variety(mg) in the center of my statement (such as pd*variety(mg)*stage is wrong but pd*stage*variety(mg) is correct).
Glad you solved it! If it helps: next time you post, add 4 space before each line of code. It really helps with formatting
Okay great. Is this to work around the 0 issue? I've been trying to use my dataset where all 0's are changed to 1's just to see if I can make the table correctly, before I try to tackle the 0 issue. The output has not errors but the table is not there. Would you by any chance take a look at my code, if you PM me your email? I'd really appreciate it. Normally I like to work out this stuff myself, and not be so dependent, but I'm trying to get the bulk of my work done before the end of this semester because I'm starting a summer job and will have very little time to finish up my thesis before the end of the summer! Thanks again.
Look into proc template. 
What OS? Are you trying to append data to an existing tab or replace an old one/create a new one? 
On my phone, but it's something like this Libname xyz "\\drive\file";
Regression with categorical variables http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/sas/webbooks/reg/chapter3/sasreg3.htm
Is it just a typo -- should be i = i + 1; ?
You could try an iterative do loop (separate from a do loop because it is a %do) which would work like so. I made a few changes to the code as well for brevity. %MACRO loop(maxM); %DO loop = 1 %TO 12; array m{&amp;maxM.} m1-m&amp;maxM.; i = 1; do while ( i&lt;=&amp;maxM.); call symput("m&amp;loop.",m&amp;loop.); i = i + i; end; %END; %MEND; %loop(35) The only thing about iterative do loops though is that they have to be inside a macro statement.
If you're going to use a macro. . . %MACRO name(loops=); %do i = 1 %to &amp;loops ; %global m&amp;i ; %let m&amp;i = m&amp;i ; %end ; %MEND name ; %name(loops = 35) ;
If the file is tab-delimited, I don't think you should be specifying variable lengths in your input statement (level). That might be messing up the date column.
Yea, it's tab delimited, I specified the variable length because one of the levels is "V. High" and without the variable length, anything with V. High was outputting as "V." [When I remove the variable length..](http://i.imgur.com/Px8vX3X.png) I appreciate the replies so far, it's quite the brainteaser, and frustrating me to no end! 
No worries, I'm learning the hard way how frustrating SAS can be, I'm enjoying experimenting with it though! It's great when it does what you want!
What kind of job are you trying to get? Whats your background? In general, only a very small percentage of SAS programmers have any certifications. If you just got out of college and are looking for entry level work your current cert would show you've got some experience with SAS which is probably enough. (From my experience employers don't have high expectations at all for young SAS programmers. You will likely have to learn a lot specific to your job, so really they're just looking for aptitude.) On the other hand, if you were formerly in a completely unrelated field for a long time (I'm talking complete career change), then a Base SAS certification might help convince an employer. 
ok, try this data exercise; infile '/folders/myshortcuts/shared_folder/xyz.txt' PAD; input Sex $ Height Weight Age Drinker $ Level $ @63 Date mmddyy10.; run; 
I'm in a similar position. I have a SAS certificate via my university's partnership with SAS, but I never got the official stand alone certificate. There's some value there in what you have, but it's not the gold standard in terms of SAS certification. I'd recommend that you get the Base and then move on to Advanced. There's a bunch of haters out there, but I'd do it anyway if you can. More people would probably say that they're more concerned with what you can do vs. having a certificate, but this is the only standard way of showing knowledge. 
hi /r/sturg1dj, I can confirm this gave me a little push in the right direction, the PAD didn't make any difference, it read in the columns, but they were outputting in a strange numeric format eg. (17918 - which I couldn't make sense of, until I noticed each number stood for a date.) - as seen in the output in my first reply to your initial comment. Turns out this was down to SAS reading dates as "the number of days before and after Jan 1 1960". So once the dates were in using @63, I added another line data exercise; infile '/folders/myshortcuts/shared_folder/xyz.txt'; input Gender $ Height Weight Age Drinker $ Exercise_Level $41-48 @63 Date_Recorded ddmmyy10.; FORMAT Date_Recorded worddate32.; run; Which gave me [this! ](http://i.imgur.com/MFQ98Lg.png) - which I'm pretty happy with. it's not an exact recreation of 01/02/2007 like I wanted, but it's definitely converting the variable into a date which is good enough! Either way, all good. I thought I'd give some closure instead of leaving it open ended. Appreciate all the help offered over the past few days! *As an aside, somewhere along the way I reversed the date format from European to American. I had it as mmddyy10. when it should have been ddmmyy10. , I must have switched these around somewhere along the way.* 
The numeric format is the sas date format (which is number of days since 1/1/1960). You took the correct next step adding the format statement. Edit: i only read half of what you wrote. Glad I could help..haha
You can also change the line FORMAT Date_Recorded worddate32.; to FORMAT Date_Recorded ddmmyy10.; To get the results you want When you Input you are changing from ddmmyy10. to the numeric number of days starting from January 1st 1960, When you FORMAT you are telling SAS to display the numeric input to the format specified, you have LOTS of options on dates including date9. ddmmyy10. ddmmyy8., etc...
You can use UNC paths like /u/seebelowforcomment mentions. 
Ah brilliant, /u/GooseTheGeek, that's the one - It's 100% now! Delighted!
Oh good deal! The way SAS treats dates can be confusing so just wanted to make sure you weren't still struggling with it.
Recruiters pick your resume if you have it. But it's not necessary. 
 proc contents data=table1 out=tab1_contents (keep=name) noprint; proc contents data=table2 out=tab2_contents (keep=name) noprint; proc sql; select * from tab2_contents where name not in (select name from tab1_contents); quit; The first 2 steps will return two datasets with all the column names of the data. The proc sql will then return the columns in table 2 that don't match up to columns in table 1.
Proc compare base= Compare= Listall; run; This should give you the list of variables in base not in compare and in compare not in base. Don't use 'var' statement . You can use 'id' statement if you know the common variable. 
proc sort data = olddata; by id descending year; run; data newdata; set olddata; by id descending year; if first.id then newstate = state; retain newstate; run; *Edited to change to state.*
proc sort data=olddata out=good nodupkey; where id&gt;0 and state ne ''; by id; run; data newdata; merge olddata(drop=state) good; by id; run;
Yes, my bad. Editing. Thank you for pointing that out.
all of these answers are wrong or over complicated. Just use coalesce. proc sql; create table new as select a.Id, a.year, coalesce(a.state, b.state) as state from currenttable a left join oldtable b on a.id = b.id; quit;
Because COALESCE is a simpler concept than RETAIN? PROC SQL is convenient if you know SQL, but it's not native SAS and it's not likely to be more efficient.
Right, but from the description it sounded like the id and year is attached to one state. Was that not true?
Yes, you make good points. I assumed that the data matched the sample, which is always a risk if you don't know the data. Of course a rename or the solution that you proposed would also be necessary to put the new value back in the state variable. As you said, I wanted to propose that solution initially so that the OP could verify the integrity of the data after the transformation if they hadn't already. Thank you for the thorough explanation.
There is no such thing as null in a SAS data set, so you might try changing it to this: if att in (0, .) then att = 25; Also, can you post the SAS log? I'm wondering if there were any notes or warnings that might give us some clue what happened.
[SAS Data loader for Hadoop](http://www.sas.com/en_us/software/data-management/data-loader-hadoop.html) perhaps?
You can post your questions here. You'll always find someone here with some free time to answer your question. My suggestion would be reading SAS papers first. You can find a lot of things that have been implemented already. And you can build on top of that. 
I don't think that's strictly true. SAS has done a lot of worth to make new features available without having to program a ton. Between the import wizard, data loading stuff, visual analytics, SAS studio, etc, there are a ton of ways to get around in SAS and not code extensively. Tons of companies go this route. Out of curiosity, what sector are you in? And have you been to a Global Forum?
While I would expect this to be obvious in the data, SAS also has a number of special missing representations, .a - .z and ._ It would probably be best practise to use "if missing(att) or att=0 then..." to allow for this possibility (unless you're deliberately making use of those representations). 
Was it LASR? That's SAS's in-memory system. It's used by SAS Visual Analytics and will be used by Viya when it comes out.
Yes, I have been to SAS Sales Opportunities before, AKA, SUGI, AKA, SAS Global Forum. I am in the financial sector and am aware that there are many products that SAS would like to sell that are supposed to do my job for me. However, I have been programming in SAS for 20 years, and none of them give me as much power and flexibility as Base SAS does. There are certainly some tools that are useful for importing and exporting data, but Base SAS beats the tools in terms of manipulating data and actually understanding what a program is doing. Also, no tool is a substitute for knowing the data.
I absolutely agree, but that doesn't mean companies aren't ignoring that for what they deem more important. I think we'd both argue that any analysis on shitty data is shitty, but there are plenty of people out there that just want to see the final output. 
To clarify, she said she was a statistics graduate, albeit a few years obviously passed from her graduation. My guess is, she didn't mean that it's useless to be able to program in SAS language strictly speaking. Just that in most cases elaborations required are so simple that they come down to db manibulation (select/aggregate)
SQL.
Their consulting firm probably wins projects where the work is primarily data management, ETL, etc and those are the skills required It completely depends on the industry, company, group within the company. But I think there probably is a lot more with data munging, cleaning, ETL, etc than there is the statistics and modeling side of it 
Is there a decent way to get experience actually using SAS u after taking the first e course? 
Hey Thanks for the reply, The first thing I'm really looking into is data mining text strings any where from 60-2000 characters per string. I was thinking that attempting to split up the character strings into individual variables by using spaces as delimitation then outputting the column into separate data sets then combining them back into a single column to proc freq and get the highest occurrences of words could help to start analysis on the patterns in the strings. I know this approach in form sounds basic. My approach would be get the datatset with the text variable and the ID variable unique to the text, then use prxchange to remove all the !@#$%^&amp;* non text and replace them with "" ideally a nonspace. Then export to excel. Use the text to column function in excel to split the text box into X columns with delimitation set to space. Take these data sets (approx 5 @ 500k-900k rows each) import them back into SAS. Next step would be to proc freq the data sets and compile an output file for each variable that has word*count. Then merge these into 1 data sets and compile the word count results. Repeat the data cleaning process to remove any erroneous words. Final step would be using prxchange to standardise the wording Bike|Bicycle|Pushbike|etc.. all the possible entered iterations of that word to then default that to "Item: Bicycle". Then start to analyse the occurrences of words. 
Have you tried proc import? You can use the proc import code or the wizard (file--&gt;import data).
Thanks for the feedback. I will look into some free SAS based online tutorials and see what sticks.
You can use the count(*) function in Proc SQL along with the group by. so the code would be: Proc Sql; Select Team, League, count(*) as Players From SASHELP.baseball Group by Team, League; Quit; I think this should work, I don't have SAS at hand now, otherwise I would check for you. Let me know if it helps
proc freq data = sashelp.baseball; table league * team / list missing; run;
Yes. Missed that that was already a Sas dataset.
Well, SURVEYREG and GLM produce different results if you're using weighting. This [SUGI paper](http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/sugi31/193-31.pdf) explains why.
This might help: [SAS Usage Note 22910: Why are PROC GLM and PROC REG giving different results?](http://support.sas.com/kb/22/910.html)
Both helpful links. I think I was wondering, why I would think they would give different results. Of course, thats likely my own issue! haha. 
Well, they produce slightly different output. So that might have contributed. The results should be identical though.

Is there a reason you want to use Python? It seems like what you are wanting to do could be done with a batch file and task scheduler.
Angularjs is the great javascript framework that has some compelling features not for developers but also for the designers. Angularjs is very essential for the web developers to know about its importance.
Can you still send an email using a batch file? With a html formatting? If so that will be a huge help already. Well, I run some python scripts that will update an excel sheet with the data genereted from SAS, so if possible I could just do all in one program
If you want it strictly in hh:mm format, then I'm not sure there's a specific format for it. You'd have to subtract the times and then convert it manually: data work.myNewData; set work.myData; /* time is measured in seconds, so we subtract the times and divide by 3600 to get hours */ hours_elapsed = int((time2-time1)/3600); /* we've counted hours, so we're just concerned about leftover minutes, so we calculate total minutes similarly to how we did hours and then take it mod 60 */ minutes_elapsed = mod(int((time2-time1)/60),60); length hhmm $15.; hhmm = strip(put(put(hours_elapsed,8.),$8.)) || ":" || strip(put(put(minutes_elapsed,8.),$8.)); run; 
Great explanation!
Amazing!!!! Thank you so much. Exactly what I was looking for
SAS dates are terrible to work with since they come in so many shapes and sizes. The datetime format is especially crappy. A good way to work with it is to use the DATEPART and TIMEPART functions, this extracts the relevant parts from the datetime format. You can then format these TIME values using relevant time formats. And finally you can use SAS functions, in this case INTCK to calculate the exact difference you want. I'll add links to each of the thing I mentioned at the bottom of the comment. For now, I'll add some code you can try, I'm not at a PC with SAS so I'm not sure it will work 100% immediately. Data New; Set Old; Hour_Diff = intck('hours', datetime1, datetime2); Minute_Diff = intck('minutes', datetime1, datetime2); /*Add /u/SenseiCay's code for concatenating these two*/ Run; You can also try: Data New; Set Old; Format Difference HHMM.; Difference = TIMEPART(datetime1) - TIMEPART(datetime2); Run; These should put you on the right track.

SAS just released an open-source library for calling SAS code from within Python: https://github.com/sassoftware/saspy. It is pretty neat! Only works on Linux for now, but Windows support should be coming too... A Bash script that calls SAS and then sends an e-mail too works fine but I consider it hacky. If you want something robust you should really use a platform scheduler that manages and analyzes the log a lot more thorougly. 
I'm also considering the SAS pre-sales academy for an eventual role as an Associate Systems Engineer. The campus in Cary was amazing, and the tour taken before the interview absolutely floored me. But... that's Cary. Do you know anything about the experience working in a different city? I would be placed in San Francisco, with a great salary, but I want to know if what impressed me so much about SAS in the first place extends to those offices. I"m assuming since you did the Sales Academy you were also placed in a different location?
If you have the 64 bit office version then get the 64 bit SAS, which will allow you to pull in Access/Excel files straight from a simple libname. Other than that, no idea. 64bit should give you access to more than 3.2Gig RAM, but I'm thinking in 4Gig your OS would not leave you that much anyway.
what is the problem you are having? can you post a little bit of the log if it is an error message?
As /u/enaut said you haven't specified a problem. But at first glance this looks like an issue &gt;if NAME='YY' and ID=&amp;dp then eq_dose=&amp;factor*dose_mcg; &gt;else dose=0; Should "dose" in the else statement be "eq_dose"? 
Try to make your Macro work without macro variables. Then when that works add in Macro variables. 
Make sure you throw this at the end %bec(&lt;dp&gt;,&lt;factor&gt;); here's my version that works (since I don't have your source data): %macro bec (dp, factor); data _cumulative; NAME='YY'; ID=123; dose_mcg=1; if NAME='YY' and ID=&amp;dp then eq_dose=&amp;factor*dose_mcg; else eq_dose=0; run; %mend bec; %bec (123, 0.5); 
Yes! You can learn more in this blog post from [The SAS Dummy](http://blogs.sas.com/content/sasdummy/): [How to run SAS programs in Jupyter Notebook](http://blogs.sas.com/content/sasdummy/2016/04/24/how-to-run-sas-programs-in-jupyter-notebook/). As it says in the blog (and video), "This is just the start for SAS in the Jupyter world"!
I am not sure if this is one of the SAS blogs you are referring to: [Are 64-bit client applications twice as good as 32-bit applications?](http://blogs.sas.com/content/sasdummy/2012/04/03/64-bit-versus-32-bit-apps/). There is a bit of technical language there; there are also some things understandable even to the layperson like me ;) "Except in a few unusual circumstances, the 64-bit versions do not offer much advantage." And from one of the user's comments on the post: "x64 SAS runs about 3% faster than x32." I hope that helps!
To elaborate a little - the extra RAM will help if you want to work with large datasets in memory, e.g. when sorting / summarising / doing hash joins.
If you're dealing with Office at all, make sure that the bitness matches. For what I did at a couple of places, I couldn't tell the difference between x64 on a Xeon and x86 on a shitty computer. I did prefer to leave the heavy lifting to Teradata, though. There's going to be compatibility issues somewhere down the road. You may not notice though.
Assuming MEMSIZE is set to 0 or a value larger than 3.2GB Always check your global options and sysvars folks
So, in essence, what youre saying is that the second option makes the most sense to you? That is, not embedding the DO LOOP within PROC PHREG.
I honestly didn't think the first approach would work at all, but apparently proc phreg does support a number of data step statements, including the ones you're using (I'm not that familiar with the statistical side of SAS). I suggest you test to make sure, but I suspect those are equivalent.
Thanks for that. So, if anything, you'd suspect that the first approach would be more inclined to error? The reason I ask: Ive done it the first way, and from what I can tell its worked, but I'd like to do it the second way because I have to run a series of regressions so its a bit cumbersome to re-do the DO LOOP every time. 
I forward you to the great Robert Allison's blog http://robslink.com/SAS/democd_blogs/aaaindex.htm And Specifically this post http://blogs.sas.com/content/sastraining/2014/08/22/how-to-show-recessions-or-other-ranges-on-a-time-series-plot/
My old pro does heat up but never needed to enter sleep mode. 
especially with the SSD I would think so. 
I run SAS on mine, she purrs.
Great t hanks!
What are your specs? 
Just use proc sql with group by clause. 
Why not plot a histogram? Proc univariate data= ; Var variable; Hist variable /midpoints = 0 to 100 by 1; Run;
I think the agism is not so bad, especially if you are working for government or government consulting. We have a bunch of people on our team who are near retirement. I think the key would be getting the SAS Advanced certifications to bridge the resume gap. 
I think SQL can handle everything at once with DISTINCT and it's more inefficient to use SQL and then SORT. PROC SQL ; CREATE TABLE summed AS SELECT DISTINCT ItemID, Version, SUM(Quantity) FROM old GROUP BY ItemID, Version ; QUIT; You could even do all of this with a sort and a data step (not use SQL at all), but it's a bit more involved (code-wise) and it might not be more efficient. 
Hi. First, given I have a BS and not a MS or PhD wouldnt it be pretty impossible to work as a statistician unless I did go back to school for MS? Then, I guess my question is, is it "unwritten but known paradigm that is followed" that once a person turns a certain age like 50, they are considered seriously past prime to be considered as a valuable candidate for a non-managerial, non-lead programmer position? In the world I have come from, having to learn new tech at a crazy pace I think is a special contributer to the belief that 50+ just not up for whats required, and, I think this is not so much in the statistical programmer world, so here trying to verify my "hypothesis" :) . Again all comments so appreciated, thanks very much!
Interesting! I am pretty good as a programmer, and enjoy it, but, interesting... Thank you for replying! 
/u/enriquex said he had to sort and remove duplicates, so DISTINCT was the first thing that came to mind. You're right that it doesn't make sense though. Not sure what he/she was doing that created duplicates in the data. 
 proc freq data=x; table item_id*version /list; weight quantity; run;
You can also do this: proc summary data='x' missing nway; class Item_ID Version; var QUANTITY; output out='y'; run;quit;
Cary is the headquarters for SAS. Regional offices emulate the employees out there. No regional office is as glorious as the Cary campus, however, you will find accessibility to resources no matter the location. If you're thinking about taking the job because the groundskeepers are great at their work, you might want to reconsider why you're taking the job or move to become a groundskeeper and appreciate the glorious work they do around the 900 acres. 
Why couldn't you do a simple time series regression? It might not be extremely informative, but it won't hurt.
proc sort data = olddata; by id1 id2 date; run; data newdata; set olddata; by id1 id2 date; /* To keep payment, tax, and interest the same for the add-on months, add those variables to the retain. */ retain id1 id2; output; startdt = date; if last.id2 then do i = 0 to 6; date = intnx('month', startdt, i); output; end; run;
If you need to know the relationship, then a linear correlation wouldn't give results much different than a simple regression.
Have you been liking it so far?
Since you only have 4GB of RAM you won't notice a difference. If you had 1200 GB of ram, then a 64 bit system would be able to access all of the available memory, but the 32 bit version would still only be able to access 4 GB of memory no matter how much was available.
For both your points you won't be limited by the arima procedure. If I remember correctly crosscorr is the option for incorporating explanatory Xs into your time series model. Whatever you end up with you should be clear about your confidence in the final product before you present it, good luck! 
Thanks for the code. I was able to link the datasets, but 3 columns were added (Startdt,I,Date) and are coming through with periods. Any clue what I might be doing wrong? 
First off, thanks for getting me this far. Sorry to ask you to ELI5, but I just don't know enough yet to troubleshoot. I received an error that their weren't enough arguments in the intnx statement when I removed Startdt and i. Here is my program with the exact id names. Where PSUID = Id 1, Group_Number= ID2, and MBMMRR_AFFCTD_YRMO= Date from my previous example in the post description. edit: where work.query_for_forecast_group = existing dataset ------------------------------------------------------------ proc sort data = work.query_for_forecast_group; by PSUID Group_Number MBMMRR_AFFCTD_YRMO; run; data Future_Months; set work.query_for_forecast_group; by PSUID Group_Number MBMMRR_AFFCTD_YRMO; /* To keep payment, tax, and interest the same for the add-on months, add those variables to the retain. */ retain PSUID Group_Number; output; startdt = MBMMRR_AFFCTD_YRMO; if last.Group_Numer then do i = 1 to 12; MBMMRR_AFFCTD_YRMO = intnx('month',startdt,i); output; end; run;
The idea work great on its own, but I tried in the macro I wrote, and turns out the cards line is causing problems in the macro. Data want; Length grp best8.; Input grp; Cards; 1 2 Run; Maybe I need a different way to enter the dataset? 
No problem. When I said to drop them, I meant to add a "drop" statement to the data step. That just removes them from the output data set and should make it less confusing.
I think something may be of wrong with the 'if last.id2 then' statement. It's not returning any data on the date column. I'm guessing because the if statement is not being fulfilled
I got it to work..mostly. Hopefully you can help me with just one more part. I need to adjust the intnx format. My data only uses year-month format (201604 for April) since payments are always made on the first of the month. The current intnx formatting is outputting the date wrong. For example where i=12 date is output as 201949 when it should be 201612.
I've never used statistica but from my brief look into it seems that the major difference is that most SAS analysis is performed through code. This makes it a little less user friendly but much more flexible than an menu based user interface. There are 2 mains types of processing in SAS that you'll want to cover. * DATA STEP: Is generally used to process and create a SAS datastep. Some simple examples would be reading data from a space or comma delimited text file or adding a new variable to a dataset. * PROC (procedure): More or less a predefined function in SAS. Usually allows you to specify options to customize output. Some simple examples would be PROC MEANS to calculate descriptive statistics or PROC PRINT to create a report from a dataset. This is obviously a readers digest of SAS but hopefully it should give you enough of an idea what direction you might want to go in. 
Hi there! Not sure if you already have access to SAS but if you don't, you can take advantage of University Edition as a free tool http://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html. Also, note the free eLearning options and tutorials that may help with your project: http://support.sas.com/training/us/sp1.html Good luck! Should you have questions you can also post to Analytics U Community, here: https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Analytics-U/bd-p/sas_analytics_u
SAS is highly flexible and has a range of different interfaces from Base-SAS Client, SAS Studio, SAS Enterprise Guide, SAS Visual Analytics, etc. You can write code and submit it, or you can use the interface.SAS Studio and SAS Enterprise Guide, for example, have a drag and drop interface that allows you to create a flow from data-&gt;statistics that you want-&gt;report all without writing any code.
More details 
Check your parentheses. Test your code. Check the log to fix the issues. Don't use output as variable name. And then let us know what kind of help you need. 
Here's an article that maybe of interest that was recently posted! http://time.com/money/4328180/most-valuable-career-skills/
Thanks!
Im in US, thanks though
This helps to melt all of my doubts about not dropping SAS to focus on R or Python. Thanks.
What does the pay premium mean ?
from the heading at the top I'm assuming that its something close to "if you have the same skills as someone else plus this special one, you can expect to earn XX% more" 
Has SAS gone back to standing for something? For years, they had removed the "Statistical Analysis Software" as the meaning for their acronym.
Here is some general information/resources that may help: SAS Macro Programming for Beginners http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/sugi29/243-29.pdf Macro Language http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/mcrolref/67912/PDF/default/mcrolref.pdf Macros Tips: http://blogs.sas.com/content/publishing/2015/07/07/macros-tip-include-vs-macro-language/ and http://blogs.sas.com/content/publishing/2015/01/30/sas-authors-tip-getting-the-macro-language-to-perform-a-do-loop-over-a-list-of-values/ 
It stands for Semicolon After Semicolon Ehuehue
I think it's proprietary, but SAS said this (a possible hint): "SAS®9 includes a rewritten SORT algorithm that incorporates threading and data latency reduction algorithms. The SAS®9 sort uses multiple threads and outperforms a SAS 8 sort in almost all circumstances."
Is the scale of agg_dose very small? The very low parameter estimate and even smaller standard error seem to indicate that. Have you tried scaling it up before fitting a model (e.g. multiplying everything by 1000 or even 1,000,000). Fitting MLE on such small scale can lead to numerical convergence problems.
I like it. In 20 years of programming in SAS, I've never heard that.
I don't know myself. But I do know the type of sorting used in a PROC SQL step is called a "threaded sort" because it tells you in the log. I wouldn't assume it's the same method in PROC SORT but just in case this is useful information. 
No, SAS is just SAS. As I understand it, once SAS became a global company, the Scandinavian Airlines System basically said that we could still use SAS acronym so long as it didn't officially stand for anything. 
The support for Unicode characters in formatted data was added to SAS 9.4 Maint 3. Here's a [blog post from the SAS development manager](http://blogs.sas.com/content/graphicallyspeaking/2015/07/29/unicode-in-formatted-data-sas-9-40m3/) about this feature, with an example. I was able to get your example to work with this code. DATA d; INPUT var$ y; DATALINES; sigma 2 alpha 3 ; PROC FORMAT; VALUE y_Fmt 2='input(*ESC*){unicode "207B"x}(*ESC*){unicode "00B2"x}' 3='(*ESC*){unicode "2020"x}(*ESC*){unicode "2020"x}'; VALUE $var_Fmt 'sigma'='(*ESC*){unicode sigma}' 'alpha'='(*ESC*){unicode alpha}'; RUN; TITLE "This is (*ESC*){unicode beta}(*ESC*){unicode '207B'x}(*ESC*){unicode '00B2'x}"; PROC PRINT DATA=d; FORMAT var $var_Fmt. y y_Fmt.; RUN; PROC SGPLOT DATA=d; VBARPARM CATEGORY=var RESPONSE=y; FORMAT var $var_Fmt. y y_Fmt.; YAXIS LABEL="This is (*ESC*){unicode beta}(*ESC*){unicode '207B'x}(*ESC*){unicode '00B2'x}"; RUN; If you don't have SAS 9.4M3 but you want to try this, you can get access to the [free SAS University Edition](http://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html) for learning purposes.
I do have access to the newest SAS version and will try your fix first thing tomorrow. Thanks!! 
I think in its purest form this is an integer programming problem. It should definitely be possible with the OR package. Here's the idea I have about solving the problem **Variables** * i is the index in 1 to n * let xi be either 0 or 1, indicating whether entry i is included in the data set. This variable is what you want to solve for. * Let hi be the ith entries height. * Let ai be the ith entries age. **Objective function** * Max sum from 1 to n of xi (assumes you want max number of people in the subset) **Constraints** * sum from 1 to n of (xi)(ai) &lt;= (30)(sum from 1 to n of xi) * sum from 1 to n of (xi)(hi) &lt;= (69)(sum from 1 to n of xi) solving this will give you an optimal solution of what to include. So is it possible? Yes. Would it be easy? I don't think so..... 
Use proc sql with sub queries Proc sql; Create table tbname as Select av_height From tbname_1 a Where a.av_height &gt; (select avg(b.av_height) From tbname_1 b Where a.field = b.field ); Quit; Or something like that 
Commenting here so I remember to post a more thorough answer tomorrow, but the likely reason it didn't work for you before is because you can't use the lag function with conditionals. SAS gets wonky.
I still get the ONESEVEN was not found. Essentially my data is a questionnaire and my professor has jumbled up data so we have to clean it before performing analysis on it. When I run a freq q1 I get that there are many different things stored in the q1 column, what I would like to do is get rid of all things that aren't in the range 1-7. 
My data has about 10 of these questions that should only be within 1-7. When I use Q1a :$oneseven. Q1b ... I get the right answer but my data is stored as character rather than numeric. When I use Q1a $oneseven. Q1b .... I get the entries in the Q1b column are effected, which was why I used the colon in the way I did. Here is the format and reading part of my code https://imgur.com/a/78a65
For a decent approximation, band your age and height variables into suitably meaningful segments and use proc surveyselect to produce a stratified sample.
What exactly doesn't work? What does the log say?
Your current firm offers SAS classes to all employees, but they don't have any SAS jobs available? Is there any potential for SAS to make your current job less soul-crushing? Maybe gaining a solid background in SAS could allow you to create your own job and make things run more efficiently for the company. In response to your original question, I'd definitely be in favor of hiring someone who completed the first five or six courses on that list. That would show me that you have the aptitude to gain more SAS skills and complete analytical tasks.
Studio is a basically just an browser interface for 9.4. 
You're welcome! Good luck!
I've noticed that too. I think PROC SQL makes a lot of simple things easier. It's less code for a lot of things. Plus the language is a bit more intuitive. I also get the feeling lots of people have introductory experience with SQL outside of SAS, so it is more familiar to them. This is all anecdotal though. I went through a phase where I wanted to do everything in SQL, but nowadays I feel like it's utility has diminished. 
No proc sort necessary, aggregation without having to do a proc means.
One of the strengths of SAS is you can frequently do the same thing in many different ways. Some people come from a SQL background and PROC SQL feels comfortable/familiar to them. Or sometimes it seems easier to use SQL than SORT/MERGE/DATASETS/TRANSPOSE/whatever. (Sometimes it isn't, and the SQL solution seems more complicated.) There are other places in SAS which have (rather different!) ways to program in SAS, such as SAS SCL (Component Language, which has Object-Oriented programming for SAS), and SAS IML (where you can use matrices and also import R code). A lot of this stuff is not *really* necessary, they're mostly just other ways of doing the same things ¹. I personally tend to use what I know, and slowly learn other methods as time goes on. ¹ There is some stuff in SCL (standalone apps!) and IML you can't do any other way (without doing a ton of SAS macro programming); I'm just making an "in general" point here.
As someone who has taken all but a few of the courses on this list, I agree. The first 6 give you the most general SAS programming knowledge.
Easier to use for different types of joins/creating new data sets with variables from a bunch of different data sets.
Thanks! I'll concentrate on these first!
Thanks! I can stretch out my sabbatical to 3 months, so here's hoping I can put a decent dent in those courses!
The big thing is not having to sort first. Also, you can do multiple joins at once.
I recruit for data analytics positions so I'd be happy to give you some tips. PM me if you're interested. 
&gt; I feel I have to look up an example 80% of the time I want to do anything. :P This is my experience with most all of the languages/programs I work with. 
Sure, but when do you ever have to look up SQL syntax? 
I'm new to SQL, so every time. There are a fair number of people who use SAS who do not come from an IT/programming background, but from a statistics/business/public health background. 
I'm not sure what your final output needs to look like. Sample retain and count. Data dout; Set din; By id; Retain count; If first.id then count=1; Else count=count+1; Run; 
You need an index so you can sort and get the order back to original. You need a count function for each brand. Then you want a count function to count each time a 1 appears in the brand count. * keep the order of the rows; DATA car1; SET car0; RETAIN mainOrd 0; mainOrd = mainOrd + 1; RUN; PROC SORT DATA=car1; BY Brand mainOrd; RUN; * count for each row among brand; DATA car2; SET car1; BY Brand; RETAIN brandOrd 0; IF FIRST.Brand THEN brandOrd = 0; brandOrd = brandOrd + 1; RUN; PROC SORT DATA=car2; BY mainOrd; RUN; DATA car3; SET car2; RETAIN uniqueCnt 0; IF brandOrd = 1 THEN uniqueCnt = uniqueCnt + 1; IF uniqueCnt &lt; 4 or (uniqueCnt = 4 and brandOrd = 1); * Filter for selecting records; RUN; 
if Hot=0 then HotDays=0; else HotDays+Hot;
I agree, this would work!
http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrdict/64316/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a000213236.htm &gt;As a corollary if I know that its less than say, 100, and I specify 100, would there be any consequence? You'd get an out of bounds error IIRC. 
First you need to determine what format the date field is in (after you decide which variable is the correct one). When you do a proc contents on the data set, if the variable looks like a date, it is either a character field with the date information represented in text (like '20160528' or '29MAY2016'), a numeric variable containing the digits of the date (like 20160528), or a SAS date/datetime variable that is formatted as a date or datetime. If you have either of the first two, you'll convert the variable to a SAS date field. If it's character, do this: newvar = input(oldvar, yymmdd8.);. If it's numeric, you'll do this: newvar = input(put(oldvar, z8.), yymmdd8.);. If it's already a SAS date variable, you should be good to go, but you can reformat the variable like this if you prefer: format oldvar yymmdds10.;. If it's a SAS datetime variable, do this: newvar = datepart(oldvar);. Then you can reformat as well, if you like. Hope this helps! Let me know if I'm misunderstanding your question.
How would I create a new variable based on the date and sample? I'm having a hard time trying to figure out how to do that.
If the three exam dates and blood levels are in the same observation, you could do something like this: array lvl {3} lvl1 - lvl3; array dt {3} dt1 - dt3; maxlvl = max(lvl1, lvl2 lvl3); do i = 1 to 3; if lvl{i} = maxlvl then maxdt = dt{i}; end; If the various levels and dates are in separate observations, do this: proc sort data = mydata; by patient_id lvl; run; data maxvals(rename = (lvl = maxlvl dt = maxdt)) ; set mydata; by patient_id lvl; if last.patient_id then output; run;
I'll do that!! I just want to get this damn assignment done, regardless!! Failing to figure out how to create a summary variable for depression!!
Your data handling makes my head hurt. Why not just sort each of the original permanent data sets with an "out=" and merge them all in one step? I know your goal here is to do statistics, but please try to be efficient with your data for the sake of others sharing your disk space and processing power, both now and in the future.
Done!!
I figured out how to do it. We got: proc freq data = fulldata; tables (insert summary variable) run; proc freq data = fulldata; tables DMDYRSUS; run; One question I have is what is the best way to create a summary variable? **For the outcome, there are 10 components we are looking at. We are looking at Mental Health - Depression Screener (DPQ_H) (Data file). The components are** **1, Have little interest in doing things (DPQ010)** **2. Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless (DPQ020)** **3. Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much (DPQ030)** **4. Feeling tired or having little energy (DPQ040)** **5. Poor appetite or overeating (DPQ050)** **6. Feeling bad about yourself (DPQ060)** **7. Trouble concentrating on things (DPQ070)** **8. Moving or speaking slowly or too fast (DPQ080)** **9. Thought you would be better off dead (DPQ090)** **10. Difficulty these problems have caused (DPQ100)** Question is..based all the variables created, how would we make a summary variable out of these so that it's easier to run a univariate distribution? 
The little SAS book is a good go to resource for a physical copy. It depends on how much programming and statistics you already know to gauge where to tell you to go from there. 
As someone that learned SAS in the not-to-distant past, I think the best thing to do is find a dataset and try to do some things that you might want to do. Load the data, do some cleaning, add columns, remove columns, generate summary statistics, etc. It's hard to learn without *some* direction. I actually played around with some sports data to help me learn a few things (its plentiful). You can get a formal SAS certification which doesnt matter so much in my line of work but could matter if you're looking for a promotion. 
I'm sorry. It's not your fault. I blame whoever didn't teach you about efficiency. Good luck!
Perhaps hire a tutor or look up videos. I'm in the same position as you. I have no experience with SAS at all and found it extremely difficult to an assignment that I had to do. I was pulling my hair out all day yesterday trying to come up with some codes to answer some questions. Luckily in the place where I am interning some people are experts and I hope to learn more with them, since my class isn't really helpful at all. 
Thanks, one of my coworkers had that book on her desk. I'll see if she will let me borrow it. 
Luckily I have tons of datasets to use. My new role requires me to use SAS everyday, but we mostly use templates. I'm hoping to eventually not just understand the templates fully but be able to improve them. 
You could put it in all in an array statement. As long as the variables follow the same format in the same array you could write code to include any number of ordinal/ranking variables. Here I provided an example where a series of ranked text variables named RANKVARA, RANKVARB, and RANKVARC are given corresponding new variables to be recoded into. You don't have to follow the formatting exactly, I just like outlining it like this because it makes the code much easier to read. ARRAY RANKVARS(*) RANKVARA RANKVARB RANKVARC; ARRAY NEWVAR(*) NEWVARA NEWVARB NEWVARC; DO i = 1 to DIM(RANKVARS); IF RANKVARS(i) = "very likely" THEN NEWVAR(i) = 3; ELSE IF RANKVARS(i) = "somewhat likely" THEN NEWVAR(i) = 2; ELSE IF RANKVARS(i) = "not likely" THEN NEWVAR(i) = 1; ELSE NEWVAR(i) = .; END; 
Clinical does have work from home. Contract and perm. If you choose this, I'd recommend joining a CRO first for experience and then move to a pharmaceutical. 
Follow the lessons step by step, you'll be able to get better at SAS. https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat480/node/7. Look into SAS publications with programs and work on making the code more efficient or copy the code for practice. Read a SAS paper and a program not written by you as often as you possibly can. If you want it company is willing to pay for, you can take the certification. It'll force you to study SAS by a deadline and get better at it. 
Pretty much. The loop iterates the block of code between the DO; and END; statement.
Awesome, thanks so much! I've wanted to figure out how to do this for a while- you just saved me from cluttering my code with like 150 lines of if-then statements.
team=strip(compress(team)); Try this statement to see if there are any leading or trailing blanks. If it still looks different, try upcase(team) along with the above statement. 
Thank you for the fast reply! I just tried &gt; team=strip(compress(team)); but that did not address the issue - so it seems to be something different than leading or trailing blanks. Trying xmindallas suggestion now and see what happens. Thank you for offering your help! 
That is the industry Ive been working in for years as a programmer - travel/hospitality. Could you elaborate on that vertical a bit? I know Dis and the big theme parks do analysis, could you name examples of other companies you know of?
Compress(team,,'kw'); Or Compress(compress(team,'190'x),'164'x); 
That's awesome! Thank you for following up with the solution. I will definitely keep that compress syntax in mind.
I'd probably keep it very simple. You could just create a variable like attendance per win in a data step and then do a proc print by league and team, listing the attendance per win value for each year. Then you can see whether the attendance per win is consistent over time. By the way, I believe the league and team are necessary because I think the team is actually the city where the team is located. Using the league as well will deal with the duplicate cities.
Ahh, well you said Intro to SAS, but I didn't know it was also Intermediate (or Advanced?) Statistics.
You just getting the basic cert? 
I took [this Python sas7bdat parser](https://bitbucket.org/jaredhobbs/sas7bdat/), [ported it to JS](https://github.com/dumbmatter/sas7bdat-js), and then used [the FileReader API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader) to read files and send them to my parser. So it all runs in your web browser, client-side.
Prepare for base SAS and advance SAS certification. You can google for the material and the SAS website has a list of books and papers to cover. Also try google!!
I dont know, I hadnt thought of that. I had heard it was difficult to get hired for that first position as a SAS programmer, and had seen other suggestions of getting both the Basic and Advanced to get foot in door. 
Hi, I think ODS might help you here, it allows you to capture the table being output by the proc surveyfreq. This can then be played around with, depending on your needs. I don't have your dataset, nor do I know precisely what you have and what you want. But I've had a go with what you've provided, give me a shout if this helps guide you any closer to what you want to achieve. data example; do i = 1 to 50; xxx = floor(rand("uniform") *100); yyy = floor(rand("uniform") *100); year = floor(rand("uniform") *10)+1975; variable1 = floor(rand("uniform") * 10); output; end; run; ODS TRACE ON; ODS select Surveyfreq.Table1.CrossTabs; ods output Surveyfreq.Table1.CrossTabs=example2; proc surveyfreq data=example; strata xxx; weight yyy; table year*variable1/row cl; format year year.; title "How to make output I don't have to spend a ton of time modifying?"; run; ODS TRACE OFF; ODS select all; proc sql; create table example3 as select RowPercent, Rowstderr, Rowlowercl, rowuppercl from example2; quit; Just replace example with your dataset and tell me what you think. 
Thought this resource may be helpful to you https://support.sas.com/resources/papers/freq92.pdf
Don't most blogs have essentials itself at 3 months?
I do have access through my school, but thank you!
Taking three months just to study for the essentials exam. 
1 day? That seems extraordinary. I know they have classes but I don't think you leave certified. http://blogs.sas.com/content/sastraining/2010/07/22/zero-to-sas-certified-base-programmer-in-3-months-part-ii/
You may have already considered but I would suggest opening a technical support track to discussions your options http://support.sas.com/ctx/supportform//createForm
The appending of the .DATA can be ignored - all that's telling you is that it can't find the DATA element within the LIBNAME called TABLENAME (as opposed to a catalogue element or similar). It's a layover from the fact that SAS uses a physical filesystem for it's own BASE engine libraries, and so needs to distinguish between a dataset and any other element that it might find in the folder. It reuses a lot of the error handling/messages for other library engines (such as ODBC). The core problem here is that it can't find any tables within the library. If it was struggling with the library, I would expect to see a message saying something like "Library LIBNAME not assigned." Some questions I would be asking right now, as a SAS Admin: * Is the table visible in the explorer window within SAS Studio? Are any? * How are you assigning the library? Are you using an ODBC libname statement in code, or is the library configured in metadata? If metadata, ensure the AssignMode is correct. * Are you 100% sure of your connection information - any chance you have connected to the wrong schema or similar? If you're using LINUX/UNIX as your SAS platform, be aware that case matters, and often does even if you're connecting to a target that doesn't care about case. I've had examples before where trying to connect to an SQL server called DataBase didn't work, because I configured it as Database, and it only worked when I changed the case of the B. * How does your authentication work - any chance that through your desktop you connect as "you", but on the server you use a service account, that doesn't have permission to view the table in question on the database? If this was the case, I would expect a rejection at the libname stage, but if the permissions on the target database allow PUBLIC connections, just not access to data, then this comes into play.
Post description requests how to do this in SAS EG, within its interface. I'm trying to familiarize myself with this toolset, so how would I do this in EG? (I don't mean, create a code-node and just put the code in) - I want to know how EG approaches this. So if you could kindly address the SAS EG approach, I'd appreciate learning how to do this in SAS EG. Thanks.
I would imagine the way SAS EG approaches this is to open a code node and put the code in. EG is a good tool, arguably much more suited than the traditional Base SAS for a large scale environment, as it uses metadata - it's designed for power users and those new to SAS, alike. The built in Tasks and similar are designed for quick turnaround of things, and people who are new to SAS - the code node is how power users will supplement what the built in tasks do. Not everything you can do in SAS is available within EG's GUI. In fact, one could argue that only a fractional subset is available. The GUI doesn't really expand into macros, for example, which are a key component of most SAS users' toolkit. If you've been sold EG on the basis that you'll never have to open a code node again, then the person is either massively underestimating your requirements, or doesn't understand the point of EG. To go back to your core question: if you have a requirement to view catalogs in EG without using SAS code to achieve this then you'll need to install an add-in to EG (for example [Chris Hemedinger's](http://blogs.sas.com/content/sasdummy/2013/11/25/11-custom-tasks/) suggestion). If you want functionality beyond that, then unless someone's written another extension to EG, I would imagine you can't do it within the GUI. One could argue that's evidence enough that the "proper" way of doing it (either by design or convention) is just to open a code node and do it that way.
I think you're missing something simple here like a semicolon. I've seen that error many times. Keep staring at the screen and you'll get it... Perhaps you didn't define your libname? Best of luck. 
Hm...sounds like you've covered your bases well then. I'm struggling to think of what would come next. I'll let you know if anything else springs to mind.
I was able to successfully run other ODBC commands againsty connection and retrieve table names, seems that I am missing something with the pass thru SQL. The end-goal is to load a couple of GB worth of PostgreSQL db data (and/or AWS Redshift) into SAS for our analytics team to work with. I am also exploring data transfer via flat files now as well. I honestly don't know the "right" way do do this in SAS and cannot seem to find an official statement on the matter.
Are those variable names from Excel being changed on import with the old set-up too? Was it just doing a better job of substituting incompatible characters? Would it be feasible to change the variable names in Excel to what they used to translate to? Are there settings in the import that you can change? I know there are multiple options in EG for that. I check "Rename columns to comply with SAS naming conventions" and "Import using SAS/ACCESS interface to PC files whenever possible." I'm not sure which of those may help, since I'm relatively new to EG.
Are you on a 64bit system by any chance? I just had the same issue at work and our IT team installed a file called AccessRuntime_x64 which fixed the issue for me. This allowed me to use the same code that we have been using for several years without having to update anything in it. 
In my (limited) experience, SAS very rarely give official statements on these sorts of things. Their standard response will normally be along the lines of "there are many ways to solve this problem, do what's right for you". Often they are right, there are enough moving parts that it's difficult to give advice. For my own two pennies worth - at my company we use passthru extracts, and flat file loads to land data in SAS. Normally passthru is preferred, but there are often reasons why we need to use flat files; e.g. the DB is operational and data is being inserted in real time. For reconciliation purposes, it's sometimes preferable to take a point in time extract to a flat file. However if the data doesn't change minute to minute, a passthru query is quicker to set up and requires less maintenance long term. I don't think there's a wrong answer here - it comes down to how much more time you want to spend on the problem. Best of luck!
1) DBMS = EXCELCS uses PC Files Server to build your Excel file. It's a piece of SAS software, which doesn't require a license, and which houses some Microsoft drivers. When you call the SAS code, SAS is able to use the drivers in the PC Files Server to "build" your Excel file. PC Files Server, requires the PC Files Server to be installed and running to work though, either on your local machine if you're using Base/Display Manager, or often on a remote server if you use Enterprise Guide. This is why it's saying "ERROR: Failed to connect to the Server." 2) The variable names that it's changing are ones which are greater than 32 characters in length. This is a [documented SAS restriction](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrcon/65287/HTML/default/viewer.htm#p18cdcs4v5wd2dn1q0x296d3qek6.htm). It's likely that your previous method of import handled things automatically for you, without notifying you in the log. When my company upgraded 9.2-9.4, we found a few things where our 9.2 was just handling things for us, and our 9.4 would require us to be more explicit. I'd agree with /u/xmindallas - the simplest way of getting you working is probably to rename the input variables on the worksheet to what you want the SAS variables to be - thereby taking out SAS guessing for you.
Cheers, using two steps could be the way to go then
Use the RANGE option like this: PROC IMPORT ... ; RANGE="Sheet1$B2:H200"; RUN; (EDIT: If you're trying to do multiple ranges at the same time, I'm not aware of a way to do it, other than reading each range as a separate PROC IMPORT, then combining the results later.)
One other thing you could do is make a new Excel sheet that uses Excel formulas to reference the other cells, to make it one nice rectangular region in Excel, for SAS to then pick up.
This is probably the best solution. 
If you just want to stack the two data sets in the same output data set, you need to set them together instead of merging them, like this: data both; set sophomores seniors; run;
I'm getting an error with this. Even when I try to open both datasets at once I'm unable to--the system only wants one open at a time? Any ideas? Perhaps it's because all of the variables have the same format across the sets?
just this. It happens just by trying to open both tables (and when setting them together). https://imgur.com/7Dn5cd1
I tend to veer on [this guy's]( https://blog.codinghorror.com/do-certifications-matter/) side. I have seen highly-certified people that are nigh worthless and I have seen completely uncredentialed people that run circles around everyone else. A cert never hurts, but it would never positively impact my decision to hire some one. At all. I especially get really suspicious of a resume that is heavy on credentials and light on accomplishments. Just solve problems, add value, and use PROC GOOGLE.
Code? Also, by chance are you trying to import/open while it is being read by another program/other person? SAS gets grumpy when you do that.
Basically the code that was posted by xmindallas. I tried again with some minor location changes ... and these are the error messages. Am I just attempting too much? https://imgur.com/a/r5Bp4 
Most people online and in-person are going to say that certs don't matter as much as your experience. The certificate is generally considered to be a non-factor or at best a tie breaker in a hiring decision. But ask yourself this: Do the people who say they don't think certificates matter have them themselves? If incompetent people can earn certificates, why don't more people earn them?

Thank you, this worked perfectly! 
Might be a bit late to help you with this. But I thought I might offer some advice. proc sql noprint; select count(*) into :column_count from dictionary.columns; where libname = "[LIB]" and memname = "[Dataset]" and name like "%[column]%" quit; %put &amp;column_count.; this should give you a variable called column_count so you can drop that straight into your do loop: i.e. do i = 1 to &amp;column_count.;
They take time to prepare if you don't know all the material. $180? A resume builder is less important than one or two nights out?
All things being equal it doesn't hurt, but I personally would rather read something like "used x tools in SAS to accomplish y which lead to z% greater revenue/z reduced FTE hours in the process/established control process/whatever." A pretty piece of paper that you paid $180 for doesn't really convey much other than the fact that you are at least sort of familiar with the software suite. I would rather spend my time solving business problems and earning money while doing it. 
Add the VALUEATTRS=() option, which works just like LABELATTRS. One thing I've learned about SGPLOT: When googling, google for "SAS 9.4 sgplot" (without the quotes) to make sure you get the SAS 9.4 reference. PROC SGPLOT has changed a lot (added many features) going from 9.2 to 9.3 to 9.4.

If you're talking about EG, yes, it's extremely glitchy. It also gives me an error pop-up when I try to use the clipboard, but the action (copy/paste) works after I close the pop-up. I've also experienced the same thing you mention. That's why I'm always very careful to save my code frequently.
And for the love of god don't accidentally click on the edge of a variable in a large dataset; it will get the impression you want to resize it. If you haven't saved recently, kiss your next hour goodbye.
Datayear?
I use EG for editing programs and running sections of code. When I want to run anything significant, I run it via a Unix terminal. Spend some time learning how to do that and you will never regret it.
From my phone. Apologies for the formatting. From my phone. Data example2; Set example1; Poverty_line = 10000; Ratio = income / Poverty_line; Run; If the poverty line depends on the number of house hold members then I would suggest using an if-then-else statement to define that line. E.g. If household = 2 then poverty_line = 15000; Else if household = 4 then poverty_line 25000; Hope this helps. You can also look at formats to transform the household size to a number representing the poverty line (look up process format). Or if there is a relationship between household size and the poverty line that can be expressed algebraicly then you could also do that in one line.
I'd use 2 arrays to preserve the source scores. Definitely arrays though. /u/slobbishbodysfw nailed it.
Edit: Found answer to my own question. Sharing in case anyone might have same problem. See source below under section 'How to get into trouble with contrasts' lol . Source: http://www.lexjansen.com/wuss/2004/coders_corner/c_cc_it's_a_pvalue_all_right.pdf &gt;In determining which is the ‘first’, ‘second’, ‘third’ , etc. group, SAS uses a character-based sort of the formatted values of all observations with non-missing values of the analysis variable. If the programmer is not conscious of this, it’s possible to code the procedure in a way that mislabels the pairs of groups being compared.
yes, /u/slobbishbodysfw is correct and correctly did not do your HW for you. Another helpful tip for the tedium of some code writing is to master the use of Excel's (or similar) autofill, concatenation, etc. as an efficient code generation workaround. 
Look into logistic regression. You want to treat the problem as classification - update your training dataset with a new column with a value of 1 for grade &gt;= 70, 0 for less than 70. There are other classification techniques as well. Or if you are only interested in comparing the groups, not predicting if grade will be less or greater than 70, just filter the groups after you score them

but instead of looking pretty like: Variable1 | Variable2 | Variable3 ----------------------------------- Var1Rec1 | Var2Rec1 | Var3Rec1 Var1Rec2 | Var2Rec2 | Var3Rec2 Var1Rec3 | Var2Rec3 | Var3Rec3 it looks like: Variable1=Var1Rec1 Variable2=Var2Rec1 Variable3=Var3Rec1 Variable1=Var1Rec2 Varaible2=Var2Rec2 Variable3=Var3Rec2 Variable1=Var1Rec3 Variable2=Var2Rec3 Variable3=Var3Rec3 Any way to keep it all nice and summarized in table format instead?
I suggest looking for something that rhymes with schmorrent. I knew a guy who got the advanced book that way, but couldn't find the intro book. Of course, I wouldn't suggest downloading it. That would be illegal and wrong, even if the test is a money grab and does a REALLY poor job of showing if you're a competent programmer or not. 
Sort of. You can specify locations using @ in the put statement, like this: data _NULL_; set mydataset; if _N_=1 then put "Variable1" @15 "Variable2" @30 "Variable3"; put Variable1 @15 Variable2 @30 Variable3; run; Which will give something like this: Variable1 Variable2 Variable3 1 2 3 4 5 6 Here we can't use put _ ALL _ because we need to specify the actual variable names, tho.
Post the text file if you legally can. 
you're focusing too much on certification. sounds like your real goal is developing your skill set. Take as many SAS courses as your company will pay for. they are all pretty great. certifications help your resume. I have seen job postings where they will only talk to someone with certification, but most dont require it. the most impressive thing on my resume is my breadth of experience and the well known companies Ive worked for.
Data dout; INFILE '......txt'; Input &lt;variable names&gt; $; Run; 
Saving
you can do multiple data set merges as well.
Not on different variables. 
Are you overwriting the original data set? If so, don't. If you overwrote the original data when you created your new variable, there isn't really a way to get it back unless you can somehow re-create the original data set.
Hi thanks for your help. I have both the altered set and the original. I just want to insert one variable (column) from the altered set to the original original and i tried the INSERT statement but it didn't work as I planned
Assuming you have unique row ID PROC SQL; CREATE TABLE T3 AS SELECT T1.*, T2.myvar FROM T1 LEFT JOIN T2 ON T1.ID=T2.ID; QUIT;
Data final; Merge original(in=a) new_var(in=b); By common_variables; If a; Run; 
Make arrays for the 8 variables and check each for occurrences of A and B, etc. Increment a variable (ctra, ctrb, etc.) when you encounter one of those values. Then check ctr variables and take appropriate action. Don't forget to set all of the ctr variables to 0 before you begin looping through the arrays.
I'm not clear what you mean by permutations. I'm assuming you mean the variables contain A, B, C, D. X=catx(' ',Var1-var8); If indexc(X,'A')&gt;0 &amp; indexc(X,'B')&gt;0 then flag='Y'; 
I only ever use data steps to merge files because sql joins aren't that intuitive to me. In this example, what would be the difference if you replaced LEFT join with RIGHT join? 
Joining tables is all a matter of what you are used to. MERGE isn't particularly well behaved, particularly with many to many. FROM **T1** LEFT JOIN **T2** LEFT joins include all rows of the first table (T1): if there are no matching rows in second table (T2) then all T2 columns are missing (T1 row still appears once); if there are multiple matching T2 rows then T1 rows are repeated; any unmatched rows in the T2 are ignored. RIGHT joins are the same going the other way. The behaviour changes for INNER and FULL OUTER joins
Just tried it. No luck. proc sql noprint; select count(*) into :column_count from dictionary.columns; NOTE: The query as specified involves ordering by an item that doesn't appear in its SELECT clause. where libname = 'work' and memname = '_2' and name like '%qty%'; WARNING: This SAS global statement is not supported in PROC SQL. It has been ignored. 
I guess what you're looking fir could be done by a proc sql and a case expression. http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/proc/61895/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a002473682.htm
Look into index function or indexc. http://support.sas.com/publishing/pubcat/chaps/59343.pdf. Contains only works with where statement in sas. 
See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sas/comments/4oj24a/a_good_resource_listing_various_courses_available/) if you haven't already! I'd second the recommendation for the official SAS training videos. They are interactive, and will help people who are new to SAS or programming in general. There's an incredible user community around SAS, if you weren't aware. While they aren't videos, [communities.sas.com](HTTP://communities.sas.com) is a great forum for asking questions and [sasCommunity.org](HTTP://sascommunity.org) is a user-run wiki with daily tips, many useful articles, papers, resources, and links.
Sorry, on phone. Syntax is probably all wrong. If index(variable,"name")&gt;0 then other_var = "other name";
Oh, good to know! Thanks!
You'd probably be best off using a macro. But I assume you don't have experience with macros either, so the basic concept is: DATA fifty-data-sets ; SET master-data-set ; IF _N_ LT 201 THEN OUTPUT data-set-1 ; ELSE IF _N_ LT 401 THEN OUTPUT data-set-2 ; . . . RUN ; Essentially, you have to name all the data sets you want to output to. The set your master data set. Then tell SAS which observations to output to which data sets. The \_N\_ variable is a SAS automatic variable that keeps track of how many observations have been read. So you can use it to set your conditions. That's the most basic way. 
Thanks! Just to make sure, the _N_ should allow me to keep the same format correct? Also, I have very basic knowledge of macros, but I am very curious as to how a macro code would look like in this case. 
As long as you don't change the format when creating the new data sets, the attributes will be copied from the master data set. 
http://imgur.com/hkud9F4 This is an example of what the dataset looks like. The end product should report the patients who were adherent and their basic demographics. I was thinking of pulling specific records using your proposal and then use SQL to report it for my end-product. But lets say I dont want to SQL all 50 datasets, would there be a way to do this all in the data step?
Can you please see my updated post and see if it makes sense?
Is that exactly how the data set looks? That is, is the first column the doctor name, then "adherent" or "non-adherent" only for one observation, then missing until it changes? If that's the case, then it would be easier just to fill in the missing data for everyone and use a WHERE or subsetting IF. DATA Adherents NonAdherents Other ; LENGTH adherent $ 12. ; SET All ; RETAIN adherent ; If Physician_Name NE " " THEN adherent = Physician_Name ; IF upcase(strip(adherent)) = "ADHERENT" THEN OUTPUT Adherents ; ELSE IF upcase(strip(adherent)) = "NON-ADHERENT" THEN OUTPUT NonAdherents ; ELSE OUTPUT Other ; RUN; I think that should work. Sorry, I'm on mobile and it's a bit late. This will create 3 data sets. One with all the adherents, another with non-adherents, and then one with the observations with doctors' names. Depending on what you want to show you can then use PROC MEANS or PROC FREQ on the new data sets. Edit: it occurs to me that you care about demographics by doctor. This won't help if that's the case, but you can create another variable that retains the doctor's name and then use PROC MEANS by doctor_name. 
Yes and no. The data basically looks like this ( I say basically because I can get it to look like this. The raw data is not like this.) So between adherents and nonadherents, you have the patients names. Patient names who fall between adherents and nonadherents are classifed as adherents and the same trend continues for nonadherents until we get to a new physician name listed as doc B. One note, the image is a little wrong. The adherent row should all be blink besides the adherent label. If you look at the nonadherent format, that is accurate. The nonadherent row is all blank with patient names starting right below. i.e. compare the nonadherent format with adherent format with respect to variables patient names and physician names and youll notice patient names are shifted one cell up, which should not be the case.
Probably stretching past my knowledge of hardware software interactions in a SAS environment, but just a couple of questions: Are you using high performance PROCs? How many CPU cores do you have allocated? What processes are you running? Neural nets that can easily have operations run in parallel, or data steps that are more I/O bound and subject to being serial? 
You can use ODS OUTPUT statements. For example something like this: ods output FitStatistics=fitstat; proc phreg data=..... ..... run; DATA fitaic; set fitstat; where Criterion='AIC'; RUN;
Fair enough. I wasn't trying to be critical. But I think you could've accomplished the same with fewer lines of code. If you head a few weight columns, the array bit would have been the way to go. So for your purposes, this would've done it: data auto_clean; set auto_noisy_csv; if weight=. then weight=500; run; 
For what it is worth, the array approach is valuable when you are trying to clean up all null integers in a dataset. data setname; set setname; array change _numeric_ ; do over change; if change=. then change=0; end; run;
Dates in SAS always mess me up, but either that or the character version below will work....I just don't remember which. data setname; set setname; array _char _character_ ; do over _char; if _char="" then _char="null"; end; run;
Thanks for that! Just goes to show, there are no stupid questions... everyone can learn something! 
 data have; input orgid rate yearid; datalines; 1 5 1 1 2 2 1 8 3 2 3 1 2 9 2 2 8 3 2 4 4 ; run; proc sort data=have; by orgid yearid; run; proc transpose data=have out=want prefix=year; by orgid; var rate; id yearid; run; proc print data=want; run; 
That worked, thanks!
Small question. What does the.... id yearid; .... component accomplish? 
If you don't include an ID statement your transposed columns will come out named Col1 Col2 Col3 and Col4. The variable in the ID statement will be used for the column names, so in this case (since column names can't start with a number) you'd get columns called _1, _2, _3 and _4). Edit - noticed the prefix=year option. That will get added to each of the id values before the column names are created, so you'll end up with columns called year1, year2, year3 and year4.
You can make some educated guesses by looking at statements and clauses that normally contain lists of variables, e.g. * `var` * `class` * `keep` * `drop` * `by` * `rename` * `order by` * `group by` This is isn't guaranteed to give you a complete list- you may find that the quickest and most effective option is simply to read the code, understand what it's doing, and work through it step-by-step to make sure it still works as you change it. E.g. you might find that in some places lists of variables are specified without all the variable names actually being written out, as SAS has various ways of referencing lists of variables: http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrcon/68089/HTML/default/viewer.htm#p0wphcpsfgx6o7n1sjtqzizp1n39.htm
What do you mean by *'s?
Maybe it's worth trying to do the same thing backwards. Just remove the SAS keywords, numbers (not touching characters), and special characters (other than underscore). After a little trial and error, what's left will be just variable names.
Thanks!!
Yes. You can access a list of variables from any temporary or permanent dataset by querying dictionary.columns. Dictionary.columns is a dataset that is automatically created by SAS which contains metadata about datasets. http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/sugi30/070-30.pdf
OK - many thanks. But how do I get it to loop across my variables and then export it into excel as separate sheets
Not really. SAS Proc SQL is easier to use than SQL server and has some nifty shortcuts. The SAS put() function for example replaces to_char() and cast() functions. For the most part, your SQL should function mostly the same when copied/pasted over. There will be some syntax issues of course, but if you already have a strong grasp of SQL, it will be easy to troubleshoot/break-fix. Learning the basics of the Data Step in SAS will supplement your SQL nicely and make things easier on the SAS server. Good luck.
Proc SQL is probably more powerful than "normal" SQL. You should be fine.
Some people sell practice questions for base sas online. You can google it. 
You can use distinct or unique. http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/proc/61895/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a002294522.htm
Yep thanks - I'm a noob for how to post code like that on Reddit haha.
Ok, that makes more sense to me. One more question, does it matter if a 'numeric' column is next to a 'character' column followed by another 'numeric' column? I.e. does the function scan for all the numeric columns across the data or do I need to arrange them properly? (sorry about all the questions, but it would be a big help if I can get this to work!) Your help is much appreciated. 
Okay, so my variables, ID, price, start_date, end_date, should remain consistant. Building up the number of observations month over month would be preferable because there are new products coming into the market all the time.
First, I'd examine why the code fails in EG. Is it because the SAS session is running on another platform (Windows vs. UNIX), or is there a SAS system option that's set differently? If it's a path issue, try adding some conditional logic for building the file paths: /* Use the IFC function as a shorthand for if-then, returning a character string */ %let tgtpath = %sysfunc( ifc(&amp;SYSSCP. = WIN, \\sasprod\root\dept\mydept\project, /r/node/vol/vol01/mydept/project ) ); libname tgt "&amp;tgtpath."; ([Example explained here.](http://blogs.sas.com/content/sasdummy/2016/06/24/assign-libname-based-on-os/)) A common system option "gotcha" is the setting for allowable variable names. EG sets OPTIONS VALIDVARNAME=ANY (to allow spaces and special chars in a variable name), but Base SAS is typically OPTIONS VALIDVARNAME=V7. Setting that option in your program can help your EG program behave the same as your Base SAS program. If you truly need to detect whether you're in EG, check for this macro variable: &amp;_CLIENTAPP.
Yeah I'm using _clientapp now to detect eg, but I also need to detect if it's running in base was, so I just look for %exists(_clientapp) = 0. In addition, I have to detect if I'm running in batch sas, so I had to do something different there too. Thanks.
How much data are you talking about and what format is it in? There are probably quite a few different tools you could use.
Was googling SAS academy and this thread popped up. Would you mind helping me with how you were able to get into the program. Current senior with sales experience, dreaming of the opportunity you got. Thanks!
That would violate my contract. I can't legally do that.
Another slightly uglier but more customisable option is to use `call execute`: data _null_; call execute('data want; set '); do date = '01jan2014'd to '31dec2016'd; file_date = put(date,yymmddn8.); call execute(cats('mylib.test_file_',file_date)); end; call execute('; run;'); run; Rather than using macro logic, this uses one data step to write another. Also, by using a simpler loop and a date format to construct the data set names, this avoids a pitfall with the loop in your original code, which will look for non-existent dates like 31st February.
I don't have access to SAS at the moment. I can provide the logic now and code later. 1. Use proc sql dictionary / proc datasets to get the list of all of the datasets present in the specific library. 2. You can concatenate them using separated by ',' or ' ' into a macro variable dsets. 3. Then use a %do loop and %let dset&amp;i.=%scan(&amp;dsets. ,&amp;i.); to get individual dataset name and then use &amp;&amp;dset&amp;i. when calling individual dataset for merge/set. Hopefully someone else can provide the code for you. 
There's code out there to dynamically assign every filename in a directory a unique identifier (i.e. file1, file2, etc.). Once you get that, you could use macro language and proc append to combine all the data sets into one. 
Very cool. Thanks for the answer. I'm in that integrity&gt;reporting&gt;etl job now and it isn't a challenge now that everything is worked out and I'm trying to move up to something harder. Any tips on what specifically to show I know when applying for predictive outcomes or finance positions? 
Wow, exactly the same situation as you. I worked in pharma and then went into finance. what kind of work do you do in finance? I've been in credit risk for the past couple years.
Can you tell me the pros and cons of using a headhunter vs through the company? Does the headhunter from then on act as a middleman for your income? Do you get the company's benefits (insurance) or the staffing agency's? Just wondering because my former roommate used a headhunter and didn't like it, but I heard many people prefer to use them.
Finding a job at all is the real point. Good headhunters get a fair number of requests from companies looking for programmers. Yes, the headhunter is a middleman, and you use the staffing agency's income and benefits for a year. However, in my experience, they paid pretty much what the real job paid anyway. Sometimes the real company will hire you permanently at the end of your term, sometimes not. As far as cons go, one of my contracts required me to not work for the real company for 1 year after my term ended. This was to prevent them from circumventing the staffing agency signing bonus or whatever, not sure why. It was annoying because 6 months later the real company wanted to hire me, and we had to wait.
Have you got a degree? what type of experience do you have? thanks
