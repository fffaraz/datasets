Use proc iml to send your data to R and produce graphics there. I'm my opinion the graphics are easier to control there and of better quality. 
SAS VA is a BI tool, like a tableau or PowerBI. R does not have an Enterprise BI tool AFAIK. 
You’re looking for display rules. https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/vaug/67500/HTML/default/viewer.htm#n1lptr5t4ek3mxn15rcft6psxr3q.htm Did you try that approach already?
I did try this...however it only allows me to set one rule per “bar”
We use enterprise guide for our programming...SAS visual analytics for our dashboards or interactive analysis 
Yeah, I think you may need to get creative with rules, so it depends a bit on the bars. Not in office today but may have some time on Thursday to check. But, you pay for Tech support, so ask SAS directly as well. SAS Communities is just a user community. 
The three things that help make sense of many of SAS's quirks are: 1. SAS was originally written when data was stored on punchcards and tapes, and you couldn't hold lots in memory. So many operations (particularly DATA statements) treat the data as a collection of individual rows, and aren't very good at doing stuff across multiple rows at once. 2. For similar reasons, SAS tends to assume that things are in fixed positions. So columns tend to show up wherever they were created, and many operations that *do* look at mutiple rows do weird things if the data isn't sorted properly. 3. The SAS Macro language is a fancy way of automatically creating text. If you're working with macro code, then what actually happens is that SAS processes all the macro stuff first to produce text, then once there's no more macro stuff left it tries to run that text as normal SAS code.
Those are all great points. Of course the counterpoint is that sometimes the sequential processing is less complicated and more efficient than creating a huge Cartesian product. And there is also proc sql if you do decide that's a better solution for your particular application. I mostly end up using it when I want to retain duplicates across various data sets that I'm joining.
https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=Sas Here are some free classes on coursera. Also there are VODs on SAS' website. 
I've posted it before, but I ran through the [free elearning](https://www.sas.com/en_us/learn/academic-programs/resources/free-sas-e-learning.html ) from SAS. It didn't take that long to run through and even after using it for an intense semester in grad school, I picked up a few things that were useful. You can use SAS with jupyter notebooks if you are used to using that with python. If you have access to LinkedIn learning, there are a few SAS courses, including on on writing macros. If not, Udemy has classes and go on sale frequently. I would use youtube or SAS university edition help for syntax help, etc. Good luck, it's got it's nuances, like any other program, but doable!
I agree with all of the point already made. What helped me the most was reading a book provided to me by the recruiter, from the hiring manager once I got the job (The Little SAS Book: A Primer, Fifth Edition https://www.amazon.com/dp/1612903436/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_UJTpCb6HWH35C). Between this, online training from SAS (many are free), and Googleing, I was surprised on how quickly I could function at a competent level. Reading existing programs from others also helps a lot as well, since it might be more applicable than the random examples on the internet. Good luck!
I second this recommendation! Read through some of the examples when I was in the same position as OP and it really helped me hit the ground running. 
You might also want to find out exactly which part of SAS they'll want you to be using at work. Is it the fairly new Visual Analytics SAS, or a specific SAS solution, or traditional SAS? If traditional SAS, which interface will you be using (batch, DMS, SAS Studio, Enterprise Guide, other?) And will you mostly be working with the data itself (data step, proc sql, etc), or will you be performing analyses on data that's already there and ready to be analyzed (statistical procs, OR procs, etc). With only a month, you'll want to focus in on as specific areas as possible! :)
I’m in the exact same boat but for undergrad research. I’m I wrong in assuming that SAS is only around because older people who haven’t transitioned to python? Everything I’ve seen been done in SAS can be easily be done in python with its wealth of packages all while being more user friendly. Thanks for the resources though, maybe was I become more familiar with it I’ll appreciate its strengths.
Absolutely. I didn't point those things out to suggest that SAS is bad, but it is weird (especially if you're used to something like SQL). It can be really powerful when it needs to be.
I agree with this...We use EG and VA and if you want to learn quick you can’t learn both...both of the apps have A-LOT to be learned
You’re wrong. It’s an Enterprise tool and R as an enterprise tool is not as developed. Microsoft bought out the Revolution so it’s getting closer to an enterprise software tool. Basically what works for small research doesn’t always work on a massive data set with 500 users hitting the same data sets - this is a reality in my org. 
Take the Coursera course or E course on SAS website. E-course is free, Coursera varies. Are you going to program in SAS or be an admin?
What type of SAS app are you using? 
Anything in Excel can likely be done in SAS. That being said, if you need help your best bet is to show what you have, your input data, and what you want. 
You'll get better responses if you edit your post to show made up data similar to what you have, and then what you want. Preferably the made up data that you make would contain the same column names as the real thing.
PTNumber = substr(Description, index(Description, ",")+1, 1);
just SAS Editor 9.4!
thank u for feedback! 
thanks! project got put on hold but I will update this post with some more info whenever I get more details. thanks for your time 
PTNumber = compress(scan(Description,2,","),,'kd') ; /\* the 'kd' 3rd parameter of compress means Keep Digits \*/
Will fail with &gt;1 digit prefixes.
I didn't read the whole post apparently. Edited, works on whatever amount of digits.
Thanks so much!
Thanks!!
If you don’t mind, I found more code that I can’t figure out and could use some help. `data _null_;` `file “&amp;sql_dir./step37.sql”;` `put “select *”;` `put “from table”;` This combination happens several times, what appears to be a file name changes to something like step38.sql or something more descriptive. The sql in the `put “ “;` statement is sometimes very simple and looks like just a check that certain data exists or it can be fairly complicated over many lines which deletes and inserts into a table. Is this running more code that exists in that file name? I hope that’s not the case because if so I have no idea how much of this project I’m missing. 
Sas access to PC files is a big key to doing this without going through hoops. The copy files task is the easiest way around this if you don't have or cant use access to PC files on a local machine. It accepts maro vars and UNC paths so if there was a network drive you had you can use it.
What do you mean new? I googled and it looks like they do them online which is new...but did they change the test? Did that invalidate previous credentials? I have a base SAS cert. The test wasn't hard but it did have a lot of more or less trick questions.
I took it last month and passed with a 75. The questions were fair but lop-sided. At least 4 questions testing knowledge of the same damn thing I didn't know, meanwhile countless other subjects were absent. 
New performance based exam. Should be in production soon. Beta testing was in November. You have to do the code to answer the questions. Still some old style questions though. 
Did you go over the content guide? It basically was the layout for the exam. I got a 73. Pass is pass to me. Didn't need the certification but the voucher was free (veterans discount) so I was like why the hell not try. I agree it was lopsided and I honestly didn't know how to prepare because this is totally new for them. 
I used a study guide from my school's library. I am going to take the advanced test this spring. I'm hoping I can get a job in the field this summer. Grats on the pass. :)
I heard a rumour back in November that it was changing. All I really heard was that the cut off mark for passing was going to be higher. I have no idea if that is true or not, but it made me panic and go get my cert in December. The idea of doing the code to answer the questions seems interesting. I think it is cool to be able to sit down and code syntactically correct stuff from the top of your head (if that is what the test requires) but I reckon it would make things a lot harder. 
Depending on your new work's set up, it might be important to also familiarise yourself with SQL. For example, where I work, we have a big, powerful DBMS. We simply pass through SQL from SAS to the DBMS and do all of our big data manipulation and joins there, because it is much faster to do so. Then we retrieve it back to SAS and perform any further manipulations before spitting the data out in a nicely formatted report. Base SAS includes SQL, so it may be assumed that if you know one, you know the other - but they are two different languages. They have their respective strengths. Most things I do with SQL, but there are some things which are massively easier with the SAS data step processing.
Hey guys, I am planning to perseu SAS Certified Data Scientist program and would like to be assured is it worth the money and time. How are the job prospects for a fresher in this field and all? It would be a great help and I thank you in advance. [https://www.sas.com/en\_in/training/academy-data-science.html](https://www.sas.com/en_in/training/academy-data-science.html)
Do you know R or Python? I would learn R because unless you intend work somewhere with SAS. R is the open source version of SAS essentially. Knowing both is gold imo. R got me my first job outside of school using Fantasy football 😂
Score requirement is definitely higher than the 68 on the old exam. It's in the lower 70s. It is definitely harder because you have to write programs in under 7 min basically. Which goes by fast lol. By mid 2019 the old exam will be no longer available. Advanced exam will be changing this year too.
I have enough R that I passed an exam on it for a class. I'm not sure the best place to keep pushing my skills, though.
I’m doing this program now as a matter of fact (paid for by my company). The courses are interesting and the material is explained well. What I don’t like is that it is in large part just a marketing tool to get people using dataflux, visual analytics, and enterprise miner. Dont get me wrong, I think em is great an use it frequently, but we use sql for data management at my job and tableau for viz, so much of the “big data” portions of the exams just don’t feel relevant to my work. I don’t really have time to play around with software I won’t be using regularly. If I had to pay for it myself then I wouldn’t bother.
A basic understanding of python...you can do alot of BI with python and there are alot of places that do it. We had to build a recommender system similar to what Amazon does with python. F# is or was used in alot of financial applications. If you know SAS and R. In the Areas of work you wish to work in. Start working in how to solve functional problems with them. For example. I work in Supply Chain Management and Logistics areas. One area of expertise was Capacity. We used SAS to un fuck the unfuckable essentially. If you can come in and already have atleast a general idea of how solve the problem your doing good. Entry level requires 3 to 5 years experience now in alot of places. Gain as much knowledge and experience as you can.
R is not the open source version of SAS, they are very very different. 
Agreed. I probably wouldn’t personally pursue this unless a company was paying. There’s not enough SAS usage and certification is gamed too much to make it a reliable indicator of someone skills set. 
Open source brother? That better for you? You can do just about a anything in R you can do in SAS. 
Prxmatch is an insanely powerful option as well. It can be a bit confusing to people not familiar with it though. [Check out this for starters](http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/forum2007/223-2007.pdf)
&gt;You can do just about a anything in R you can do in SAS. Really? You can use the same code to process and clean a 30GB file as a 1MB file? Without buying more RAM? They’re both software used for primarily statistical analysis. SAS has Enterprise offerings, RStudio doesn’t quite measure up yet on that front. Eventually it may. SAS has BI tools, R does not. 
I've been looking at broadening my skills, and I gather that both R and Python are worth pursuing. When you compare R and SAS, is that Base SAS? Or is it the whole thing?
I'm a bit confused about the question. Is the issue to do with getting the data from one source and importing it into SAS? Or is it about what kind of data manipulations or procs you need to get the data you want? Or is it about what kind of procs you need to output it in a meaningful way?
SAS Base, Stat, Graph....text miner. The core essential SAS components is what I mean... SAS VA or OA is not what I mean.

Did you see the SGPLOT code in the first comment? Did that work for you?
The comment by Rob Pratt? I tried the sgplot code he mentioned, but it doesn't seem to be working for me. Any idea as to why?
Without seeing your code or log, no. 
Ah ok, there are a lot of components of SAS I'm not really familiar with. Just scratching the surface. I suspect that text mining is going to be a big thing at work, so might look to brush up on that.
Here are some screen shots of the code and log. I believe I am using the ellipseparm statement incorrectly, or in the wrong context. [https://imgur.com/a/tmvUHuC](https://imgur.com/a/tmvUHuC)
Yep. Not a bad solution. I've found the R graphics still spank anything SAS has to offer with similar effort. This is coming from a huge SAS fan. &amp;#x200B;
&gt; Enterprise BI I suppose this depends on your definition of an enterprise BI tool. Some would argue R-Studio can operate in this capacity. There is also Power BI which incorporates R: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/desktop-r-visuals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/desktop-r-visuals) See the 
How is this relevant to the OP's post?
Your answer is not relevant to OPs post. R primarily creates static graphs. SAS VA is an expensive investment. It allows you to control who can view what reports and at what levels and who can access data at different levels. These are not features that R includes. Shiny can be a replacement but still doesn’t have that level of infrastructure AFAIK. And rolling out a server to do it isn’t a trivial task in an enterprise. I’m aware that Microsoft and SAS both support R/D3 visuals internally as well. 
Macro variables created within the macro are created locally, not globally so it's not available outside the macro loop. You can either add a step to declare them as global or just calculate them all at the start is much easier. &amp;#x200B; To create as global: `%global name&amp;i;` &amp;#x200B; or you can avoid all of this together: &amp;#x200B; proc sql noprint; select Name into :name1- from sashelp.class order by Name; quit; %let count = &amp;sqlobs.; %put &amp;count.; %put &amp;name1; %put &amp;name19.; Note the use of `noprint` to suppress output, uses the automatic `sqlobs` macro variables instead and using the `:names1-` notation tells SAS to automatically create as many variables as needed. &amp;#x200B; This is all covered in the documentation here: [https://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=sqlproc&amp;docsetTarget=p0xlnvl46zgqffn17piej7tewe7p.htm&amp;docsetVersion=9.4&amp;locale=en#p1hkib8x47zfzun1e4zg47itruh4](https://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=sqlproc&amp;docsetTarget=p0xlnvl46zgqffn17piej7tewe7p.htm&amp;docsetVersion=9.4&amp;locale=en#p1hkib8x47zfzun1e4zg47itruh4) &amp;#x200B; And you may find this reference helpful: There are several fully coded examples using macros that cover a lot of the basics needed.

Huge thanks for wonderful answer 
This is a pretty efficient piece of code and gets the job done quickly and accounts for varying length of your digits. Also, I included a second variable in case you wanted your PTNumber to be an actual number instead of character: `data work.temp;` `infile datalines dsd;` `input Description $25.;` `datalines;` `"8667DSA,2PT,243678ASD"` `"8667DSA,22PT,243678ASD"` `"8667DSA,120PT,243678ASD"` `"867DSA,120PT,243678ASD"` `"877DSA,5PT,243678ASD"` `;` `run;` &amp;#x200B; `data work.temp2(DROP=class_pat matched_class position length);` `set work.temp;` `class_pat=prxparse('/(\,)(\d+)/');` `if prxmatch(class_pat, Description) then do;` `matched_class=prxparen(class_pat);` `call prxposn(class_pat, matched_class, position, length);` `end;` `*PTNumber formatted as character.;` `PTNumber=substr(Description, position, length);` `*PTNumber_number formatted as number.;` `PTNumber_number=input(substr(Description, position, length), best8.);` `run;` &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
The objective function is what gets minimized. I’m not sure what the measure of fit would be in a situation like this. If you comment on the blog or communities.sas.com maybe Rick can answer? Or hopefully someone else has the answer. 
&gt;"Your answer is not relevant to OPs post. SAS VA is an expensive investment." &gt; &gt;It is actually. I'm not sure how the cost of a tool is at all relevant to how to achieve a graphical presentation, so I'm to set that criticism aside. But FWIW, I've seen some very expensive VA/BI tools that perform quite poorly when compared head-to-head against free, open-source, or much cheaper VA/BI software. &gt; &gt;" It allows you to control who can view what reports and at what levels and who can access data at different levels. These are not features that R includes. " &gt; &gt;The OPs question was not directly relevant to controlling report access and at what levels. As an aside, R-Studio Pro does offer controlling access to data and specific reports at different levels. That being said, there is nothing that prevents the OP from creating his or her rules within R sending the output from SAS to R rendering the graphics and replaying the graphics back from within the SAS VA reporting environment if he so chose. &gt; &gt;"Shiny can be a replacement but still doesn’t have that level of infrastructure AFAIK. And rolling out a server to do it isn’t a trivial task in an enterprise." &gt; &gt;Yes, Shiny can be a replacement and it works especially well within the R-Studio Professional System. It's no more difficult to set up and MUCH cheaper than any SAS VA environment I've ever seen. &amp;#x200B;
OP is asking how to do something in SAS VA. Saying use R isn’t a solution to the problem IMO. It can take weeks to get R installed on a server in an Enterprise role. And if you have to go RStudio Pro, the costs are about the same if RStudio charges what they have on the website. Our internal renewal costs are cheaper than the RStudio quoted numbers. 
I am not sure what your customer wants, but to weight something usually means to give it a greater impact. So, for example, I could have a data set that looks like: 10, 300, 80, 4 With corresponding weights: 0.1, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 Their "weighted value" would be value\*weight. 
Generally this is for using records that account for multiple observations, such as a summary table that has been made into a data set. in each row will be a field that accounts for how many observations the row represents. For example, you have a summary table produced elsewhere with: nr_people, agegroup, sex, outcome (dead/alive), risk(has/none) You can use /WEIGHT=nr_people to tell your analysis that the row represent nr_people records, not just one record. 
That's more aligned with FREQ - multiple records. Weights are often fractional or can easily be fractions. Often used with survey data to make a sample representative of the population. 
It depends on what you're doing. As the note indicates, it's handled differently in different situations. 
Was the data included? Or output?
Good idea. I will add it. 
A SAS dataset is in "sas7bdat" format, the proprietary SAS data file format. You need to write a data step or proc sql query to get data from the first dataset and into the second. If you want the data in a spreadsheet, you then need to export it ... perhaps using proc export.
Hi, thanks for your reply. I guess I'm confused because in SAS Studio, the file I saved is shown as "[FILENAME.sas](https://FILENAME.sas)." &amp;#x200B; I tried to start a new program and retrieve that dataset using: libname (path); data A; set FILENAME; run; &amp;#x200B; But an error pots up saying that the file does not exist (under the set statement). Is there some sort of code I can put at the end of the program in my first dataset to export the file and save it on the desktop? I think it's currently stored in the SAS Studio cloud, which might be affecting the import into the second program...
its not set FILENAME you want set LIBNAME.DATASET 
.sas is the extension of the code itself. You want to create a data from the code file, ofc it does not exist. .sas7bdat is the extension of the data stored on the server. 
&gt; a field that accounts for how many observations the row represents Surely that is FREQ, not WEIGHT?
Stick it in your myfolders. Libname fout ‘/folders/myfolders/‘; Proc copy in = sashelp out= fout; Select class; Run;quit; ‘Saving’ a data set is simplicity writing it to a permanent library. In this case, since it’s SAS UE, you can write it to myfolders or a sub folder. 
Not at all. 
Well weight is what your wife has.
Why differente languages if JMP belongs to SAS?
JMP was designed to run on Macs, SAS is not. 
My professor told me JMP stands for John's Macintosh Program. I have no idea if this is true. 
Wikipedia agrees. It was SAS first attempt at a GUI, whereas before it was all coding. 
The program code is the .sas file ... that is just ascii, a text file that contains your program. The sas7bdat file would contain any data you create or load in the data step. The data step you are showing would only create the data set if there was a pre-existing data set called FILENAME. The way you've written it, it won't do anything otherwise. Where is the data you want to bring in and save as a SAS dataset?
Hello! The question leans more toward your second option, the kind of manipulations/procs I need to get the data I want FROM my tables in excel. Cheers
If you are planning to develop any significance testing functionality, be very careful with weights. If they are survey weights, all traditional significance testing will produce inaccurate results. As noted in your link: &gt;While weighting can also be used to adjust the parameter estimates for sampling of populations defined by the predictor variables, it does not assure proper estimation of their standard errors. Survey sampling methods are required for proper variance estimation. These methods are only available in the SURVEY procedures such as the SURVEYMEANS, SURVEYFREQ, SURVEYREG, SURVEYLOGISTIC, and SURVEYPHREG procedures.
LOGIT is the method that you probably want. This is the default method and the one you will see discussed in nearly every textbook on the subject. This is the link function based on the CDF of the logistic distribution (probit is based on the CDF of the Guassian distribution). The logic model can be written as: Pr(Y=1∣X)=\[1+e−X′β\]−1Pr(Y=1∣X)=\[1+e−X′β\]−1, whereas the probit model can be written as: Pr(Y=1∣X)=Φ(X′β)Pr(Y=1∣X)=Φ(X′β). The Logit link function can be interpreted as an odds ratio so it's a bit easier to interpret than the probit model. The logit is also the canonical link function, so you are usually better off using it, but it's difficult to say without knowledge of your response distribution and without assessing fit. Can you provide more information and tell us what your response variable is and provide us with a little background and we can help you decide?
Hey, thank you so much for taking the time to help! Yea, I would love to talk more about it! The response variable is high school graduation (graduated/did not graduate) and the intervention is a college access and success program. The survey responses are weighted to account for missing data and sample variance. My real confusion lays between GLOGIT and LOGIT as they seem to be for similar purposes? The SAS documentation describes GLOGIT as: *specifies the generalized logit function. PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC fits the generalized logit model where each nonreference category is contrasted with the reference category. You can use the response variable option REF= to specify the reference category.* They describe LOGIT as: *specifies the cumulative logit function. PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC fits the binary logit model when there are two response categories and fits the cumulative logit model when there are more than two response categories. Aliases: CLOGIT, CUMLOGIT.* My in thought is that LOGIT would be the one I would want to pick as I have two response categories. What do you think?
I added some output. I will work on cleaning this up.
Ahh. OK. Thanks for providing more info. Your intuition is right. You will want to use LOGIT then. GLOGIT is used for when you have multinomial, nominal response values. You don't have that here - you have nominal Bernoulli response variables. You will use LOGIT. Are you using multiple imputation along with surveylogistic? As an aside: one thing to watch out for are "family effects." Is it possible that you have some students that are in school with siblings who might be part of the intervention? If so, it may be possible that the intervention effects contaminate the non-intervention students. Have you controlled for that? Best of luck with your research!
Have you tried playing around with PROC FREQ? That's where I would probably begin. It's good for counting things and then giving you a percentage breakdown on those counts.
use a macro variable ``` %let D=500; data want; where XXX=&amp;D.; run; ```
I initially assumed OP was writing a macro/function. In such case, you can make the entire 'where' statement a macro variable. For example the below: %let where = where programD = 500;; data want; &amp;where; run; This usage is good in a macro definition, i.e.: %macro OP_code(program, where); data want; set &amp;program; &amp;where; run; %mend;
I will try what oldschoolcool suggest. I cant figure out if it will do what i need it to do. To explain some more: Program A,B and C are running frequently in an environment where i cant change the code. Therefore i need to refer Program D in which i can change all i want.
No, I do not think I will be doing any imputation. This is federal survey data from the National Center for Education Statistics and I do not feel confident in imputing those missing values. Regarding your concern about "family effect". The intervention (a federal college access program) is quasi-experimental in nature and thus the students are assigned the treatment if the school they attend is considered low-income. It is likely that there are a number of confounding factors (including participation in OTHER federal college access programs), but my research is focused specifically on evaluation rather than a novel research study. Again, thank you for all your help in picking out the surveylogistic model! If it is okay, could we keep an open as I progress if I run into any other questions?
I like the macro solution because if you don't want to filter at all, you can just leave the second parameter blank and it won't filter at all. &amp;#x200B; At my company i have a similar situation as you. I can change the code in many scripts but don't want to forget to revert it after I test something and/or don't want to document it every time i change it. So everything becomes parameterized and goes in its own sas program that i name "[parameters.sas](https://parameters.sas)" or something. This parameter script has dozens of %let statements, small macros like the one above, data steps with call symputs, formats, etc. All macro variables will get loaded in global scope and can be referenced across numerous locked code provided everything is executed in the same sas session. I have a "driver.sas" script that %includes that parameter script followed by all of my locked code.
Just a quick clarification, are there survey weights in this dataset? PROC SURVEY... procedures are specifically designed to use survey weights. Just because it is a "survey" doesn't mean that it requires "PROC SURVEY."
Great question! Yes, there are weights associated. The dataset includes the weights as well as a number of balanced repeated replication weights. The documentation for the survey indicated that I should be using these to weight the survey sample. 
Okay, great! I just wanted to make sure since NCES does have a few datasets that are not true surveys.
One question I have about their data is what do I do with non-response and missing data? Non-response is indicated with a -9 while missing data is -8. Do I just say that variables that are in (-8, -9) should equal "."? Any ideas on how to handle this?
I often see that they are coded as "." and change the setting to "NOMCAR." NOMCAR stands from "not missing completely at random" which is a good assumption for most datasets. https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63033/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_surveylogistic_a0000000343.htm 
Thanks, that is what I thought about the coding of the missing variable; however, as I look into the NOMCAR setting I dont actually think it is the right fit. Specifically, the documentation says that: *The NOMCAR option applies only to Taylor series variance estimation. The replication methods, which you request with the VARMETHOD=BRR and VARMETHOD=JACKKNIFE options, do not use the NOMCAR option.* Because I am using VARMETHOD=BRR, the NOMCAR option shouldnt do anything right?
Yeah, your right. I noticed that as well, NOMCAR won't actually do anything since you are using a replicate design. I would still be concerned with those negative numbers being treated as valid response levels. You might still need to set it to missing.
Agreed! I have set those negative numbers to missing; however, for my response variable the negative number (missing values) are automatically removed because their weights are 0. So I shouldnt have to remove anything there correct? Also, thanks for all the help. Just being able to talk through some of this stuff is super helpful. You rock!
NP, survey analysis is super niche, it can be pretty hard to find the answers you are looking for :) A weight of zero is essentially removing that case from analysis. So I think it should be fine. 
Thanks! I have one more question as I write out this code. I feel a bit dumb for asking, but should I be modeling the event or the non-event? For example, SAS defaults to modeling the probability of the non-event (Graduation = 0). You can use EVENT= in the MODEL specifications, but I am unsure if I should be sticking with the default or not! Thanks again!
It depends on how you want your parameter estimates and Odds ratios to be scaled. Set it to whatever makes sense to you and your audience. Do you want to talk about the odds of graduation or not-graduating?
Okay okay, that is a great way to frame it. So if I understand correctly, if I want to talk about the odds of graduating I would set EVENT=1 and the odds ratio would indicate the extent to which the students exposed to the program would be likely to graduate?
I think that is correct, Event=1 would result in the model being framed as odds of graduating. A good sanity check is to see if a know variable like SES is behaving in a way you'd expect, e.g., higher SES results in higher graduation rates. From SAS: &gt;One of the most common sets of response levels is {0,1}, with 1 representing the event for which the probability is to be modeled. Consider the example where Y takes the values 1 and 0 for event and nonevent, respectively, and Exposure is the explanatory variable. To specify the value 1 as the event category, use the following MODEL statement: model Y(event='1') = Exposure; https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63033/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_surveylogistic_a0000000333.htm 
Great idea, thanks! Yes, this was super informative! Learning new things daily!
I like this solution, especially since it means you have a single file with all the customisable parameters, rather than needing separate files for each (which can be particularly dangerous if some of them might depend on each other). I often write some kind of "setup.sas" file that does a lot of this, plus standard includes, and any little utility macros I re-use a lot.
You want the quantile function. [https://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=lefunctionsref&amp;docsetTarget=n0uhywbqfucg6qn18woziy41flqp.htm&amp;docsetVersion=9.4&amp;locale=en](https://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=lefunctionsref&amp;docsetTarget=n0uhywbqfucg6qn18woziy41flqp.htm&amp;docsetVersion=9.4&amp;locale=en) &amp;#x200B; criticalValue=quantile('t', probability, df); &amp;#x200B;
&gt;criticalValue=quantile('t', probability, df); Thanks for your response! Unfortunately it's not spitting out the correct answer...
What values are you putting in and what do you expect? You can ‘test’ it by using prob = 0.025 and setting the df high so you get 1.96, ie boundaries for 95% CI. 
Did you remember to divide the probability in half to account for the absolute value, or two sided test?
As someone said the answer is the quantile function. You just need to have an understanding of the math. Because the quantile function, being a quantile, gives you X such that P(T12 &lt;= X ) = 0.15. You need to use the fact that the distribution is symmetric to compute the t value. P(|T12|&lt;=X) = P( -X &lt;= T12 &lt;= X) = 2\*P(0&lt;= T12 &lt;=X) = 2\*P(T12&lt;=X) -1 &amp;#x200B; You need this to equal 0.15. Hence P(T12 &lt;=X) = 1.15/2 = 0.625. So it's quantile('t', 0.625,12)
Thanks for the answers everybody. I will look into it. Sounds like it is just what i need :-).
Lol.
Get gud noob
Agreed. It's a PITA to use!
Compared to what?
I think it's awful for everyone but we're all suffering from sunken cost fallacy. 
&gt;could we keep an open as I progress if I run into any other questions? Of course you can. I'm happy to help.
NOMCAR is relevant for imputation. If a data point is MCAR it is missing completely at random, so it's safe to assume there is no relationship between the missing datapoint and any values in the dataset. If a datapoint is MCAR (missing completely at random) you can safely ignore the missing value and perform a complete case analysis (but recall that you'll still need to use the proper weights). If a value is MAR (missing at random), then the mechanism that causes missingness is related to variables in the dataset, so you must impute the data to avoid biased estimates.
Good thing I might be a survey sampling statistician! ;-)
You need the negative numbers in certain software like SUDAAAN to preserve weights to carry out proper analysis.
Thanks for chiming in. See you at AAPOR!
Just use the OUT= option and merge that data set back to the new data set.
What about the proc compare? Which options should I use?
The allstats option will give you a table of all the summary statistics for matching variables and the transpose option will give you reports of value difference by observation instead of by variable. I'm not sure exactly what you're using it for but in a study with double-data entry I've worked on, we use conditional formatting in excel to visually inspect for non-matching data but that only works if you have reasonably small datasets!
I have to mark the data in a comulative dataset. For example, to make it easy to see that row 23 is new data. Also I need to see if anything changed compared to the previous dataset. Did they modified some data which is received earlier.
I would create a new variable that identifies each month of data before merging them then use the transpose option with an out statement to get the difference by observation (or if the datasets are small enough, use conditional formatting in excel to highlight cells that match in green, those that dont in red - the highlight duplicates feature). 
Yes,that was my first idea. Than I found that proc compare exist. In a few months the excel solution will not be feasible, as we are going to received a lot of data. Aft
Proc Compare sucks. But it sounds like you’re actually looking for an Update or Modify statement. Check those methods out in the documentation. For these types of data sets a ETL tool is great if you have access. If not, I recommend rolling your own via SQL or data step, but not Proc Compare. It needs a lot of work to be more useful. Though to be fair these are available in other tools (Data Management Studio). 
I'm not a huge proc compare fan but if I was you I would run the compare with an out and then just create dummy variables showing the source table date or name and merge it all together. Then sort it and all your changes should be next to each other when you scroll...figure out from there how you want to display it. 
I typed one comment but then I thought about it twice...why don't you just merge the two tables with a variable stating the source dates in each, then when you merge them you'll be able to see what came from where...probably get to displaying what changed a lot easier with more context. I only Proc Compare in cases where I expect both to be exactly the same or have only very minimal differences...and I don't really ever 'use' the output. It's just for verification. If it has differences, I go back to the datasets to grab the info, personally.
just the certification and date. 
You'll use the OUT= in PROC COMPARE, along with the BASE= and DATA=. Should be pretty straightforward.
Add 2 refline statements above the run; line Refline y=x axis=y; Refline x=w axis=x;
I just list my certifications, no date or ID. I'm sure date is fine if you have extra space. When I look through resumes and see ones I want to interview, I actually look on the SAS certification registry to see if it's true, you'll be surprised how many people lie about their certifications. I've had a few who just listed the certifications and didn't know how to define variables what data steps and different joins were. 
 I include my certification logo on the resume along with the date, and a hyperlink to the registry so they can check it.
1. You need to precalculate the values so you have them to plot, SGPLOT doesn’t do calculate. 2. Either hardcode the values into a refline statement or use macro variables. 
Pretty sure [this](https://communities.sas.com/t5/Graphics-Programming/SGPlot-RefLine-label-and-labelattrs/td-p/109984) is what you're looking for.
You should list the full title of the certification, the certifying authority and location (e.g. The SAS Institute, Cary, NC), along with your certification number, and the date and expiration (if any) of the certification. 
No dates, no links, no number.
omg I made it with this. Appreciate!
There are many ways to do it, I'd do it this way: Proc sql; Create table WANT as Select a.ID, b.Program, a.total * b.allocation as total From table_1 a Inner join table_2 b on 1=1; Quit;
Great! Enjoy!
Many to many like this is known as a cross join, which SQL is better at than a data step. 
perfect thank you!
good tip, didn't know cross join existed!
It looks like you really shouldn't be extending those lines. Regression models cannot be extrapolated outside of the range of data you observe - the effect may not remain linear, for example. However if that doesn't convince you, google "proc sgplot lineparm statement"
I agree...use proc sql for all your JOINS/UNIONS you’ll thank me later
Agreed! It’s much easier to understand as well. 
I've talked to so many people who were supposedly certified who obviously never wrote code. Apparently the newer tests are harder to pass by memorization, so maybe that will improve. I always ask SAS questions in the interview, and if they stumble through them, I'm very suspicious.
There are many exceptions to that rule. Just a few off the top of my head: when you want to output to multiple data sets, controlling the variables in each; when you want to process observations sequentially (usually using first-dot or last-dot logic); and when you want to create "put" reports in the log. I usually default to a merge unless there are duplicates in multiple data sets that I want to retain in the output. Both are useful tools, but neither is universally the best.
No need for the `inner join ... on 1 = 1` in this situation - just do a full cartesian join: proc sql; create table want as select * from table_1, table_2; quit;
I’m guessing your log has errors. 
I can confirm that the plot statement has been superseded by [ODS graphics](https://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=statug&amp;docsetTarget=statug_reg_details39.htm&amp;docsetVersion=15.1&amp;locale=en). That said, if OP really want to use it, he technically still can by using the lineprinter option on the in the PROC REG statement, eg: proc reg data=sashelp.cars lineprinter; var msrp horsepower mpg_city; model msrp = horsepower mpg_city; output out=results r=residual; plot residual.*mpg_city; run; Which yields a plot that looks something like this: ----+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+----- RESIDUAL | | 100000 + + | 1 | | | | | | | R | | e 50000 + + s | 2 1 | i | 2 1 | d | 12 1 13 | u | 1 24 611 1 1 | a | 1 26 3* 9*6 42 321 1 1 | l 0 + 1 2 665 ** *** *3 *4* 14 7 1 71 21 1 1 + | 1 14 26* ** 69* 21 231 1 | | 12 331 36 152 | | 1 1 12 1 | | | | | -50000 + + | | ----+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+----- 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 MPG (City) MPG_City Really though, the default ODS graphics residual plot is so much better.
Thank you - sgplot was very helpful!
I have a data file that I want to import, but the spaces between data range from 4 blank spaces to 10 blank spaces. I know I can just copy and paste the data into a DATA step with detained. But I want to be able to do it without copying and pasting. Thanks.
Someone more experienced might be able to provide a better answer but I would try column input. 
It looks like it's space-delimited, So, 1-4 Is first variable, 5-10 next, etc... To import, you can import all into chars, then convert later. 
Read a fixed width file by specifying the start and ending column descriptions https://go.documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=pgmmvacdc&amp;cdcVersion=9.4&amp;docsetId=lrcon&amp;docsetTarget=n1w749t788cgi2n1txpuccsuqtro.htm&amp;locale=en#n1bn90npgf11k8n1v7a36psrik84 
I could be wrong but that appears to be tab delimited. 
It's not. Notice that the data aren't aligned on the front, but on the back. So the 10ths and 100ths place lines up. 
By the way it shouldn't matter since you have all numbers. Just use an input statemt with the appropriate informat and it will correctly read it in since there are no values you need to read in with spaces. 
Informat. That's what I was missing. I'll have to try that in the morning. Thanks!
Actually, after a more careful look, you shouldn't even need that. just use an input statement. Here's an example where I read the data directly from within SAS, but the same thing will work reading in a file rather than the cards statement. data work.temp; input patient time hb; cards; 1 13 14.6 2 52 12.0 3 6 11.4 4 40 10.2 5 10 13.2 6 7 9.9 7 66 12.8 8 10 14.0 9 10 7.5 10 10 10.6 ; run;
We had an assignment where we had to do something similar to this in one of my graduate SAS classes. We had a bunch of phone numbers with different separators. Prof wanted us to use catx it other variations of that. One work around was entering multiple delimiters in the delim statement. It worked try it out. 
I don't has SAS Studio installed but have you tried these instructions? http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/webeditorag/67794/HTML/default/viewer.htm#p11aook1n9du6tn1mn1e2g8g98zt.htm I believe you are looking for the second set of instructions listed in which you find a config file in the sas studio install folders and add a line to it telling sas which browser to use. See if that works for you.
Check the version of SAS Studio you’re using as well as the version of Chrome, then see if this helps: https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Studio/Issue-with-SAS-Studio-on-Chrome-v67/td-p/466242
Are you using University Edition? SAS Studio is accessed via a web address, copy that into the other browser and it should work. 
Sas works fine for me in chrome. You gotta copy that ip address (local host) and it will work . For further info follow the instructions as posted above^
Advice on the cert or advice on replicating something you need from SAS or....? Little confused why you want the cert if your company won't be using it. I don't think anyone uses it for personal use. I know it was forced on me, I would never opt to use it personally. 
If you can learn R, you can learn SAS. Seriously. I'd you have enterprise guide, do the point and click tasks then examine the code. Google the proc used to get additional information on options for that proc. Data manipulation...learn data steps and when to use SQL instead.
Use the certification prep guide. The certification program is changing this year, so you can choose either multiple choice or actually programming. 
Oh really? How do they grade the programming?
I assume it’s similar to datacamp/code academy type tasks but haven’t taken it. 
I just wonder how many there are, and whether I have to get them right on my first try. If that is the case, I have no hope of passing. If I can run the script and then make adjustments before I submit, that would be a lot better than multiple choice.
Here’s the page. https://www.sas.com/en_us/certification/credentials/foundation-tools/base-programming-specialist.html
This mentality makes no sense. People come here continually trying to be certified as a professional at something they've never done as a professional. Even if you do pass this test without having any SAS experience, you will be virtually worthless at a SAS job. Why would you even want a job where you'll be worthless?
It's for a masters program. The other languages used thus far were python R and SQL.. there's no way around this for me unfortunately. 
They can't write their own tests, so they're misusing someone else's test that was never devised for that purpose? It's infuriating to me that a university is encouraging students to pass tests at the absolute exclusion of developing skills. If you didn't go through a unit where you learned SAS first, this is absolutely pointless and should make you question the usefulness of this degree.
I loved the program up to this point. Very broad in scope and applies 80% of real work/world scenarios that I've had to utilize in the past. It's just this stupid necessity of the SAS cert.. absolutely loathe this part of the program.
I know I can. I'm lacking the effort honestly.. just hoping someone would have some other tips that I can utilize 
Try training lessons inside SAS site (at least the free one). I remember there were quite in-line with certification program, and a good start to approciate Sas programming. In alternative you can find some 800 pages certification guide book online, but not the latest and (probably) most useful.
If you're a veteran then they offer all there e learning for free. Anything but data academy and self study e learning. 50% off books from sas...unfortunately they only do ebooks on their store now. Free exam certification vouchers.
In particular, consider the free course, "SAS Programming for R Users": [https://support.sas.com/edu/schedules.html?crs=SP4R&amp;ctry=us](https://support.sas.com/edu/schedules.html?crs=SP4R&amp;ctry=us)
As someone who TRULY hated SAS when I first used it, I understand. The implied data step loop is the antithesis of good programming, and the code that most SAS "programmers" write is atrocious. The overuse of PROC SQL and macro calculations make for code that is difficult to read, maintain, and usually very low performance. However that all changed when I came to understand the PDV, which is really the point of the language. The SAS datastep PDV is like a simplistic, high performance R environment that stores simple variables (doubles and strings), arrays of these, and hash objects in memory. The synatx for carrying out operations in this environment is basically like any other programming language. The only addition is that it can read and write these environment variables to the rows of data sets, stored out of memory, which allows it to naturally handle very large data sets. On top of this there're are user defined functions (PROC FCMP, PROC DS2), an interpreted scientific language (PROC IML) which is better than MatLab IMO, a very well integrated SQL implementation (PROC SQL), a whole slue of very robust modeling/analysis procedures, and well developed meta-programming facilities for compile time calculations (macro language, CALL EXECUTE, and DOSUBL function) that should be used only for meta-programming. It's worth learning. I just wish that SAS/CONNECT were part of base SAS.
In a veteran.. where do you activate the free certification and e-learning? .. probably could Google this,.but f it. I'll ask 😆
I needed to hear this so much. I feel dumb for struggling with this compared to other languages .. I assumed it would be a quick learn with my past experience. I feel quite advanced at SQL but this has been a serious blow to my ego. I just don't think the cert exams are even great for testing your understanding. I wish the program I was in could opt for a different cert.. oh well. I will study the PDV and programming portion more. Thanks for your time.
You can create a new column that just has the mean of variable x by doing something like this: var\_mean = mean(Variable X) Then you could calculate the difference by doing Variable X - var\_mean. Since you don't need (and probably don't want) a variable populated with only the mean, you can then use the drop var\_mean statement at the end of the code. Hope that helps!
Hi, thanks for your response! I tried your method, and I'm getting the same issue (the var\_mean column is identical to the Variable X column, and so when I have a new variable = (Variable X - var\_mean), the column is populated by 0s.
I wonder if you might be better off trying something like this using proc SQL: &amp;#x200B; proc sql; create table new\_table as select \*, variable\_x - mean(variable\_x) as mean\_diff from my\_dataset; quit; &amp;#x200B; In case you're not familiar with proc SQL syntax, where new\_table is the name of the SAS dataset you're creating, mean\_diff is the name of the variable that contains the difference between the value and its mean, and my\_dataset is the name of the SAS dataset you're working with. The asterisk in the code means that you're taking all columns in your current dataset and transferring them over to the new dataset. &amp;#x200B;
That's not going to work, because data steps process along single rows so mean(variable_x) is going to take the single value in variable_x in the same row, and calculate its mean (which is the same as that value.
Option 1 (the two-step method that avoids SQL): Step 1: Use PROC MEANS to calculate the mean of variable X. Output it as mean_x into a new dataset. Step 2: Merge the dataset containing mean_x onto your original dataset in a DATA step. You will probably get a warning because your merge doesn't use a BY statement, but this is valid. In the same DATA step, you can also calculate your deviation and drop the mean column, if you so wish. Option 2 (the one-step method using SQL): PROC SQL; CREATE TABLE work.calculated_deviations AS SELECT a.*, (a.x - AVG(b.x)) AS x_dev FROM work.original_table AS a NATURAL JOIN work.original_table AS b ; QUIT;
Why do you want to do this? Usually this is a step in a process, and there are usually easier ways to do it, so that’s why I’m asking. It also depends if your data has groups and if you’re doing group means vs means for the whole data set. ******************************************************; *Add average value to a dataset; *Solution 1 - PROC MEANS + Data step; ******************************************************; proc means data=sashelp.class noprint; output out=avg_values mean(height)=avg_height; run; data class_data; set sashelp.class; if _n_=1 then set avg_values; run; proc print data=class; run; *Solution 2 - PROC SQL - note the warning in the log; PROC SQL; Create table class_sql as select *, mean(height) as avg_height from sashelp.class; quit; ******************************************************; *Add average value to a dataset - with grouping variables; *Solution 1 - PROC MEANS + Data step; ******************************************************; proc means data=sashelp.class noprint nway; class sex; output out=avg_values mean(height)=avg_height; run; *sort data before merge; proc sort data=sashelp.class out=class; by sex; run; data class_data; merge class avg_values; by sex; run; proc print data=class_data; run; *Solution 2 - PROC SQL - note the warning in the log; PROC SQL; Create table class_sql as select *, mean(height) as avg_height from sashelp.class group by sex; quit;
Exit the field you are in.
Why your method dorsal works ? Does it show error ?
The SAS base certification (at least when I took it 10 years ago, I'm assuming it's similar now) does not reflect what I would describe as modern data analysis. It was all importing data file techniques - what happens if you have a text file and an "@" delimiter? Stuff like that. I found the "advanced" certification MUCH easier, but that was because it dealt with a lot more stuff that I used on a regular basis: SQL statements, macros, more complex data processing, etc. The best advice I can give for studying for the base exam is to hammer topics on importing data and the program data vector. Figure out how SAS processes through data steps. Honestly, the data step stuff is really good to know if you want to have a career programming in SAS. All this said, if your company won't use SAS then I'm not sure why you are trying. Unless you are trying to get a job somewhere else? If that's the case, in my opinion as a hiring manager for an analytics team, having a certification doesn't really do much. It's nice, I guess, but it doesn't really tilt the scales that much. 
What field am I in?
What field am I in?
Thank you very much. I feel like this is good advice and feel you're on point. I'm ONLY doing this because my masters program is making it a requirement. I already posted a rebuttal for this requirement to the program coordinator in hopes to offer alternative languages or courses.
"Data analysis" -- you said it in your original post. People who disregard entire sets of technology simply because they were unable to master the technology probably don't belong in data analysis (or in fields that require frequent learning of new skills like programming). You're being paid to learn SAS by your employer it seems, so I don't see the problem or the seemingly brash attitude you projected in your original post. Don't hate the technology. Hate the fact that you failed to learn it. Take some time to learn the material and look what the program has to offer that you won't find in R, S-PLUS, Python, or elsewhere. SAS has a lot to offer. After all, you're being paid for this! If you're unwilling to do that despite your company seemingly providing you plenty of learning resources, and your initial reaction when you fail at learning is to declare your hate for the thing you were unsuccessful at learning, then you probably should re-evaluate the field you are in. If you think this is the last time you'll be challenged by your employer to learn something new for any specific reason, then I'd encourage you to think about something else or else to think about modifying the way you handle learning and failure. Not to sound pedantic, but you should welcome failure. Learn from it, and improve yourself. You might even find that, through pushing yourself to learn a new skill, you've just made yourself more marketable outside your current employer -- on your employer's time. I can think of fewer sweeter situations.
SAS Studio should work in Google Chrome, it's the default browser that I use. Have you tried clearing out your cookies/cache? That can sometimes help.

I need to run a regression model on another variable in the data set and the (Variable X - Mean of Variable X) columns :) 
Ah. Look at PROC STDIZE for standardization routines. 
Are you mean centering for a regression? I think the reason you're probably getting 0s is because you're not hard coding the mean. It's two steps: proc means; var x; run; Assume the mean is 3.3333, then you'll create a new variable: data new; set old; newvar= varx-3.3333; run; As long as you're hard coding the mean as an actual number rather than referencing the variable, the only data points that are 0 should be the points that were exactly the mean. 
You know what I ended up doing just that...running a code to find the mean, then simply plugging that number into an equation, and it worked. I wasn’t sure if there was a code to do it all for me, but it’s just for homework, so I don’t care enough to figure it out behind that :) thanks so much!
Yeah, anyone who says that if you can learn R you can learn SAS must be pretty crappy at both IMHO. SAS has a completely different programming paradigm than many languages. To toot my own horn more, I'm a pretty strong scientific programmer, and usually new languages are easy to pick up. But it took me a 1 year to understand what SAS is about. BTW, if you have IML studio, you can just learn to write IML code (basically a nicer version of Matlab) and call/interact with SAS and R code with little effort directly from IML.
Tldr
B.S.
Ah. Now it makes sense. You don't work at a company yet. And you're still trying to get out of learning? SMH.
If you're uncomfortable with PROC SQL, here's an example of how to do it without SQL. data one; input x; datalines; 2 4 7 5 3 6 3 ; run; proc means data=one noprint; var x; output out=mean_ds mean=mean_x; run; data two; if _N_ eq 1 then set mean_ds; set _one; x_minus_mean = x - mean_x; drop _type_ _freq_; run; proc print data=two; run;

UCLA macro tutorial. Google it. 
First intuition is to use a WHERE statement, but you could also use a BY statement too if you want to compare different colors.
How does that work? I’ve seen the WHERE and BY statements in the manual but the syntax is just so confusing. Like, if red Skittles have a value of 1 and yellow Skittles have a value of 2 (both possible values in the SKITTLES variable), what is the syntax to plot all the SWEETNESS values where the SKITTLES values are X?
Which proc are you using/exploring?
I’ve just been trying all kinds of random shit. Like... Proc plot data=skittles; By skittle; Plot skittle*sweetness I’ve tried SGPLOT, PLOT, and maybe one other. GRR. 
I'd suggest SGPLOT. I don't have the documentation in front of me, but it would be something like Proc sgplot data = datasetname; By Skittles; Scatter x = sweetness y = Skittles; Run;
Run these one at a time. Proc sort data=sashelp.cars out = cars; by origin; run; Proc sgplot data= cars; Where origin=‘Asia’; Scatter x = mpg_city y= mpg_highway; Run; Proc sgplot data = cars; By origin; Scatter x = mpg_city y= mpg_highway; Run; Proc sgplot data = cars; Scatter x = mpg_city y= mpg_highway / group= origin; Run;
Or googling "SAS macro 101", or something similar. There are a ton of resources out there.
Depending on when your interview is, I'm going to assume you won't be able to master advanced macro techniques. For a beginner, I'd break it down like this: 1. What is the purpose of the macro you are creating? Write the SAS code to accomplish your target output (whether it's a data set, procedure, or combination of both). 2. Once your code is working, start thinking about how to "macro-ify" it. Macros are basically a shortcut for executing SAS code with different processing parameters. What parameters within your code/data do you want to keep constant, and what do you want to give the user some flexibility to change? 3. Once you know this, start modifying the code you wrote in step 1 to incorporate macro logic. Put in macro variables for the things you want to be flexible. You can assign macro variables using %LET statements (very noob friendly), as values entered in the macro definition (moderately advanced), or as derived values based on some aspect of the data (advanced). What I mean for "macro-ify"-ing code is this: say you take the SASHELP table CARS and want to do few procedures on it. Say you want a PROC FREQ of the make and a PROC MEANS of the MSRP. You have a few choices: * Write a macro specific for PROC MEANS and PROC FREQ which allows the user to input a data set name. Write a macro which calls these two procedures and uses [SASHELP.CARS](https://SASHELP.CARS) as the input data set name. **In this context, you are always going to do a PROC MEANS and PROC FREQ on whatever data set you pick in the macro call.** * Write a macro which runs the PROC MEANS and PROC FREQ procedures individually. If you want a really quick and dumb macro to get you started, you should be able to look at this code and figure out what it's doing with minimal studying: %macro print\_ex(data=); proc print data=\&amp;data; run; %mend; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
"macro-ifying" -&gt; "abstraction"
I know that. I thought someone might have a favorite tutorial. 
As far as i know there is no way to append the Log for individual Programs in an EG Project. There is an Option to enable a Project Logging that is storing the Log of all Programs in a EG Project. Or route your Log to an external file. 
Sorry, you can't append logs. However, you can do your runs as separate processes, and that'll generate separate logs. When you do a new run, choose the operation that *doesn't* replace the previous run. You can switch back and forth between logs to look at how they went. Like you, I resisted the switch to EG, but eventually I got used to it.
Thank you. So many of my favorite things aren’t in EG. I want them brought back. *foot stomp*
Use PROC TRANSPOSE 
You probably want to log it to an external file. If your programming gets complex with macros and lots of includes or something the log file will slow EG down to a grinding halt once it's done running. Run this just once when you open up a project. proc printto log='filepath\file.dat' new; run; Then anything you run after will go to that file until you close the project.
Thanks! Didn't know you could transpose BY.
SAS Studio an option? I could never transition to EG but have enjoyed SAS Studio interface. 
I recommend that you try enabling the project log, which will track all submissions in a given project, similar to the way the display manager log tracks all submissions in a give session. You can access the project log by View -&gt; Project Log on the menu bar. Once you have it open you may have to click "Turn On" in the upper left to get it to start tracking submissions.
I found the two similar
Really? I liked the code snippets features, ability to drag n drop table/variable names, full log history with time stamps as well. And split screens seems easier. 
It can do all that minus some of the drag and drop features. 
Add to this. If you want to not print to the file later in a program just do Proc printto; Then if you need to continue do same like as he said but without the new. I used this alot in multi purpose programs where we grep for errors in the logs for linux. 1 sas program can run a series and output individual logs
P(*any of that happening*) = 0.
You set me on the right path - thanks much. 
I enjoy Enterprise Guide more primarily because my jobs run local and are much quicker than SAS Studio on a web application. If you have Studio local than it might not make a big difference 
Studio can run locally or via a server, exact same as EG. both are thin clients accessing a software application anyways. 
Yeah true! I still prefer eg though. I like what you can do with it and configuration for an application server compared to studio on a mid tier is just easier imo 
Are you familiar with arrays? How many stops do you have to calculate, is there a maximum amount?
Using array works. Output each stop, then take the transpose gives me the result I want.
If you want to capture all possible stops, then I would: 1. Transpose the data so that I have columns of subjid (1001, etc), day (1-6), dayvalue (0 or 1) 2. Do something like: data stops; set inputdatatransposed; by subjid dayvalue NOTSORTED; if (dayvalue = 1 and last.dayvalue); run; Although I haven't actually tested that code, so I'm sure it's got some issues (probably in the BY statement).
Read the days into an array and loop from the end of the array.
I’ve found when learning any new coding language, it’s easiest to only jot down high level concepts and any useful shortcuts you want to remember. Practicing any sort of analysis on real data or their practice data is what I found most helpful. 
I take my notes in the program, greentexting explanation for everything I'm doing. I still annotate/ELI5 all the code I write because someday when I'm not working here anymore, somebody is going to need to understand how to run the data. 
As a student i found it more helpful to jot down notes in my programs or in the margins of handouts than to try and write out some comprehensive list of procs. Programming is a lot of learning by doing, so it’s best to focus on practice and save a couple of well commented examples that you can refer to when you’re stuck on how to approach a problem. In my professional life I actually keep a reference folder of papers and code snippets I found useful, titled with the name of the command they feature or some little description of what the code is supposed to do (e.g. “dealing with duplicates”, “making an input window”) and that works pretty well for me from an organizational perspective.
I wouldn't go out of my way to write down the procedure statements, options, and such. Anything that can be easily found on the sas website really shouldn't be committed to memory (unless your tests require it obviously). When I was in my base cert prep course the way I took notes was: 1. Start with the main topic as the header; for example let's say we're reviewing the format procedure, make that your main header. 2. Create a subheader based on each aspect that is reviewed. For example, subheaders could be 'format naming rules' or 'specifying format ranges' 3. Under the subheaders I would just start a bullet pointed list of things that are important/helpful to remember but not easily found on the sas website. For example '-with custom formats, sas sets the default length to the longest value you use' This gives you the most time to listen to the actual lecture (not panicking while trying to write everything down) and helps you get in writing the information that is typically the most helpful when encountering problems in your code. I've also seen people take notes in the sas coding window which might help but I wasn't personally a fan of that method. 
data want ; set have ; array day{365} ; array stop{186} ; s = 0 ; /\* counter for stop{} array \*/ do i = 1 to dim(day) ; /\* not on last day and current = 1 and next = 0, or last day and = 1 \*/ if (i &lt; dim(day) and day{i} = 1 and day{i+1} = 0) or (i = dim(day) and day{i} = 1) then do ; s + 1 ; stop{s} = vname(day{i}) ; end ; end ; drop s i ; run ; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
GitHub. Note the specific concepts, ie this transforms a table from long to wide, this calculate summary statistics by groups, this does frequency counts. Make each include a fully workable example you can run to demonstrate how it works. I usually use sashelp.class, cars or heart in my examples. 
I made my own quiz questions and memorized
Wrong subreddit
I’m curious why you would want to use a macro for this. I think a template would be easier to read if someone else looked at your code. 
Just wrap your chosen program header in a macro with put statements to output the header to the log, then just copy &amp; paste it back into your program. &amp;#x200B; %MACRO PGMHEADER(PGM) ; data \_null\_ ; put "/\*-------------------------------------------" ; put " PROGRAM: &amp;PGM" ; put " AUTHOR: &amp;SYSUSERID" ; put " CREATED: &amp;SYSDATE" ; put " MODIFICATIONS:" ; put " -------------------------" ; put " &amp;SYSDATE &amp;SYSUSERID Initial Version" ; put "-----------------------------------------\*/" ; run ; %MEND ; &amp;#x200B; Then call it, e.g. %PGMHEADER([MyFirstSASProgram.sas](https://MyFirstSASProgram.sas)); &amp;#x200B;
Depending on what you’re trying to do, SAS abbreviations may be what you’re looking for: http://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings09/073-2009.pdf I’ve made my header to the word header and a few different dividers to things like “largediv” “meddiv” and “smalldiv”
Cool
Try a discrete attribute map and line thickness for the borders. Examples for discrete attribute maps are in the documentation. 
This macro selects all rows from the table "in" that match one of the three codes in the where clause, and creates the table "out" with the results. There is no merging occuring in this macro.
Hey, SabotageTheWrit, just a quick heads-up: **occuring** is actually spelled **occurring**. You can remember it by **two cs, two rs**. Have a nice day! ^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.

That is Correct.
Great reason to register for this session at SAS Global Forum in Dallas this year... [Everything Is Better with Friends: Executing SAS® Code in Python Scripts with SASPy](http://sasgfsessioncatalog.com/#/search/python@7)
Hahaha! Thanks but I don't even know what SAS Is.
It's software for programming statistics! Good luck, dude.
Ok! Thanks!
You can query the dictionary tables to see the data type/length. Besides simply picking some examples with "Where var=X", it usually helps me get my joins in order.
I don't think that will help me. :(
If we strip out the macro part of it and the one comment and just look at the code, it's a simple PROC SQL call that looks like this (assuming that you call it as out=outdata, in=indata): PROC SQL; CREATE TABLE outdata AS SELECT * FROM indata WHERE hcpcs_cd IN ('45378', '45379', '45398') ; QUIT; This creates a single dataset (outdata), by taking all columns (SELECT *) from the input dataset (indata), but only taking the rows where the variable hcpcs_cd is one of the three given values.
# SOLUTION VERIFIED: You have been awarded 1 datastep. 
Well, this post is certainly more fun than the typical "I need help with my SAS homework" type of message.
:P Glad I could spice it up for you. 
You can download sas university at home for free and go through their tutorials. If I remember right, there is a programming and a stats course.
Two questions. Can i download even after graduation? (Brazilian public university) One of the IT guys here told me SAS university don't have the same features SAS Enterprise Guide has (most of the them are the ones i would need here). Is it true?
Can you give any information on the type of industry or tasks that you'll need to accomplish. There are plenty of fine general 'learn sas' and 'learn sql' materials (I always liked Ronald P Cody's book - Learning SAS by Example), but it is really helpful to know the problem you are trying to solve. Are you using PROC SQL, or some other platform (Oracle, MSSQL, MySQL)? For DATETIME25.6: The '25' refers to the width of the values to be output and the '6' refers to the number of digits that will come in the seconds field. So you will expect to see (when viewing the values read-in to SAS) something like 15FEB2019:09:30:10.185394. So, if you want to work with that datetime column, you should be searching for something specific like that. And a quick search for "work with datetime sas" provides: * [Result1](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/Working-with-Dates-and-Times-in-SAS-Tutorial/ta-p/424354) * [Result2](https://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=lrcon&amp;docsetTarget=p1wj0wt2ebe2a0n1lv4lem9hdc0v.htm&amp;docsetVersion=9.4&amp;locale=en) * [Result3](https://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings/proceedings/sugi24/Begtutor/p58-24.pdf) *[Result4](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Programming/Working-with-datetime-and-milliseconds/td-p/451428)
1. Yeah there’s no requirement to be a student. I believe the “University” part just means its for learning purposes. 2. I don’t have a SAS License at work, so I couldn’t really say, but I’ve also heard that there are some features missing. It’s still a great jumping off point!
Learning SQL when you are new to SAS will either be a good or really bad experience. What I mean by that depends on how familiar you are with SAS already. SQL is a language which does a lot of the same things as SAS in terms of data manipulation, but does them in a slightly different way. If you are already familiar with the idea of merging two data sets together in SAS, there is a corollary in SQL called "joining". The end result is similar, but the mechanics are different. Plus the syntax for a SQL join tends to feel kind of weird and alien if you are used to SAS. All that said - my advice if you are learning SQL now is to look through some online SQL tutorials. All the vanilla concepts of a SQL statement (select, join, etc) are universal and can be applied once you start writing PROC SQL queries. Maybe try [https://www.w3schools.com/sql/](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) as a starting point. 
&gt; One of the IT guys here told me SAS university don't have the same features SAS Enterprise Guide has (most of the them are the ones i would need here). Is it true? This is TECHNICALLY true, but for programming and learning to program, it's the same. SAS University edition is VERY similar to SAS Studio. Both SAS Studio and SAS Enterprise Guide are interfaces for SAS programming. Both can run PROC SQL and DATA STEP code so you won't have issues with pure code, however, the UI for the point and click features of both products is slightly different. The exception to this is if you are doing complicated Statistic code at work and need to work on SAS STATS skills, SAS University Edition may not have all of the PROCs you will have at work. However, for Learning SAS It's going to be more than enough. 
Here you go. &amp;#x200B; proc sql; create table step1 as select *, value - median(value) as residual from project1 group by method; quit; proc anova data=step1; class method; model residual = method; run;quit; &amp;#x200B;
SAS University Edition is for learning or SAS Academics on Demand. If you're coding it doesn't matter which version of SAS you're learning on. SAS UE uses SAS Studio, which is different than Enterprise Guide, though the Visual PRogrammer side is fairly close. If you're using the EG GUI there are less resources than if you're programming. &amp;#x200B; [Communities.sas.com](https://Communities.sas.com) is the resource for SAS support. Take the time to format your question well and you'll get quick responses. &amp;#x200B; [Documentation.sas.com](https://Documentation.sas.com) has a ton of resources around SAS, and SQL. The documentation has a few examples that cover a lot of the basics of what you do in SQL. [https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=pgmsascdc&amp;cdcVersion=9.4\_3.4&amp;docsetId=sqlproc&amp;docsetTarget=n1ncn0pznd8wrln1tnp3xdxjz9xz.htm&amp;locale=en#n1ncn0pznd8wrln1tnp3xdxjz9xz](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=pgmsascdc&amp;cdcVersion=9.4_3.4&amp;docsetId=sqlproc&amp;docsetTarget=n1ncn0pznd8wrln1tnp3xdxjz9xz.htm&amp;locale=en#n1ncn0pznd8wrln1tnp3xdxjz9xz) &amp;#x200B; SAS SQL is slightly different than other versions, things like window and pivot are not available, for those types of functionality you can use a task or proc to achieve your goals. &amp;#x200B; The first SAS programming course is free on the SAS site or on coursera. The course is two days, if you do it full time. &amp;#x200B; Also, get the Little SAS Book for Enterprise Guide which guides you through a lot of the basic tasks. &amp;#x200B; [Lexjansen.com](https://Lexjansen.com) has papers from SAS Users going back to the 70's - which is a caution. Make sure to get more recent papers when attempting things so you don't use a 1980's approach. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;

Thank you very much for everyone that answered/helped me. Got a lot of good references and advices. Will find my way through SAS University and the material you referred to. As I like to say in my native language 'vocês são uns queridos'!! *insert kawaii gif*
I think you have already got some great answers, but I have a question; how did you get into a job like this that seems so much beyond your (current) set of skills? SQL is totally possible to learn, but still. 
Check out the free SAS programming e-learning on their site. It will teach you the basics of SAS programming and the last lesson introduces proc sql.
Yes you can still download UE. I recommend SAS on demand. It’s easier than installing UE. All you do is make an account and start programming. It does require internet access to use it though since it’s in the cloud. Like others said, while the interfaces are all all slightly different, if you are looking to program they all get the job done.
&gt; I could try to break up the hyphenated cities and then dividing the employment in half, but I don't know how to do that. If you know regular expressions, you can split doubled-up cities easily into two groups using `prxmatch()` and `prxposn()` (sorry, not at a SAS computer, so can't give you debugged code). If you don't, then you can use `index()` to see if there is a hyphen in the city field, and then use `substr()` to extract the first and second names. Say you've extracted two cities into fields CITY1 and CITY2. Then you can do: CITY = CITY1; EMPLOYMENT = EMPLOYMENT / 2; OUTPUT; CITY = CITY2; OUTPUT; This will break your one-record hyphenated city into two records, with EMPLOYMENT halved. This gets a fair bit more complicated if you can have more than two cities jammed together into one record, though.
I think you need to expand your sample data. The current situation is relatively easy to solve but I suspect it may not generalize well. SCAN() and COUNTW() are helpful functions here though. 
Ah these are always SO annoying to deal with. I’ve tried and failed to leverage regular expressions to overcome this, but I’ve had pretty good luck using COMPGED, SOUNDEX, or SPEDIS functions. For matching unstructured city names, I’ve had the best success with COMPGED. I’m on mobile so not going to muck around with formatting too much, but you could tinker around with something like this. Proc sql; Create table join_them as Select A.City_State, A.population, B.employment, COMPGED(A.City_State,B.City_State,’INL’) as Fuzzy_Score From Dataset1 A, Dataset2 B Where A.City_State is not null And calculated Fuzzy_Score&lt;400 ; Quit; You can tinker around with that 400 value to make it more precise; kind of a trial-and-error task depending on how fuzzy your data really is. See the [documentarion](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrdict/64316/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a002206133.htm ) for how the cost is calculated. The INL modifiers ignores differences in case, leading blanks, and quotation marks. You could do it as ILN, too, but I think the order matters because the N strips out quotes first before removing leading blanks. 
Thank you! Some of them are three cities combined and then some have random counties or metropolitan attached at the end 😔 but coding wouldn't be fun without roadblocks! 
Scan function has become my friend. I found a do loop code that broke up the counties and gave a new variable i that I used as a number for original coubties. I just went back and did an if then statement to split the employment by number of times it split. It worked for most of them, but I still have a few stragglers that have random county attached that is messing up the last piece 
This looks super helpful! Thank you! I will try it Tommorow. I'm throwing in the towel for tonight 😂
In the past decade Brazil was flooded with private universities. Some good, most bad. There is too many people out there technically qualified for the avaiable jobs so companies started looking for some semi-mythical "can do all kind of job employees". They want people that have some knowledge in different fields(usually math, business, finances, economics, marketing, programming and project management). Don't need to be hardcore in everything but you must know how to work around the key concepts of each. Also, its weird, but the mindset here goes more like: they are paying you to do a task, they dont care how, just get it done. I work with acquiring. Lots of clients, lots of transactions. They need some studies about our revenue, cancellations, volume of transactions, etc. The rest is up to me; since there is no way for excel to handle all that info in a worksheet, here I am on my way through learning SAS. And I am not the only one in this situation. It's bizarre but I have peers that crop the info they need from the database with SAS and do all the rest in excel. Like me, they have a demand but not proper training. 
Probably. I've always assumed it must make it easier to support the free version because it means they basically just have to support it for one platform.
They only have a windows or unix product so this means mac users aren’t excluded. And there are companies actively trying to reverse engineer their software (WPS) so they do have to protect their rights. Personally I like Academics on Demand cause it’s all cloud based, no install issues at all. 
You in India or the US or outer space?
Lol, I’m in the USA 
Academia or SAS itself
Large businesses or government are the best places because it is expensive as shit. How technically inclined are you? Learn R because you'll have more options due to cost. R is can hard to learn though for some.
SAS is good however most companies are looking to get away from SAS due to the high cost. Look into learning Python and R instead. 
Chase Bank was actively recruiting SAS developers recently.
So is in this case the app, eg. SAS, using the CPU of my pc or that on the server?
I can attest that a large worldwide health insurance company is doing this.
A rather large auto lender is doing the same. 
There is a version that runs in a virtual machine, using the hardware of your PC, and there is a version that runs in the could using Amazon Web Services. I assume you are using the former (I've never used the web version).
Any CRO most likely has a entry level programming position. I know that IQVIA (formerly Quintiles) has an entry level position and that's in North Carolina's Triangle.
First step is to go find whoever created the data in the first place and slap them with a copy of the Wikipedia article on [data cleansing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cleansing). Printed copy is fine, but if all you have available is a cheap desktop PC then go for it. Second step is to make sure you understand what is going on in the data. Are the combined cities in the second data just the sum of the employment for the two cities? Then you need to be very careful when you do your analysis because just splitting the employment value evenly between the two might not be the most appropriate treatment (in a worst-case scenario, you could wind up assigning 10,000 employment to a town with a population of 1,000, and what do you do then?). If each city in the population data will always show up exactly once in the employment data (and only the employment data combines cities together), then it's probably more appropriate to use the employment data as your indexing list - i.e. let's try to do the merge so that we get the same rows as in the employment data, but we add the combined population of each city / city grouping to it. This kind of merge is almost certainly going to be easier using PROC SQL than a DATA step. I think I would do something like this: PROC SQL; CREATE TABLE combined_emp_pop AS SELECT e.CITY, e.STATE, e.EMPLOYMENT, sum(p.POPULATION) as POPULATION FROM employment AS e, population AS p WHERE e.STATE eq p.STATE AND COUNT(p.CITY, e.CITY, 'i') &gt; 0 GROUP BY e.STATE, e.CITY ORDER BY e.STATE, e.CITY ; QUIT; That may not be 100% correct syntax (I usually get SQL code wrong at least once before writing the thing I actually wanted), and you can swap the COUNT function out for your preferred string matcher (note that it may cause bad results if some city names are substrings of each other, but on the plus side the 'i' modifier will ignore any differences in case).
Thank you!
I’m intermediate with R. Looking to learn SAS to improve my chances of landing a job. 
Thank you, will look out for any opportunities 
Thank you, I will look into it right away
Yeah, that is what I heard too, but most of the universities or hospitals, research institutions still are with SAS, and I feel they are a big chunk of the market 
If you're looking to stay pharma/research then I agree with you. I did a bit of consulting for a medical research firm and while their primary models were SAS, they were looking at other tools. My point is dont limit to just SAS. It is a proven tool no doubt. Just consider all options. 
Yeah, this is a solid advice. I’m working on improving my R skills as well now. 
Having a good base understanding of each will help alot. Have a project you can demo or a paper on it. My first real job outside of college was because of my fantasy football system using R for a System Design class. There is also python, Tableu, and Alteryx. Alteryx and Tableu require a current enrolled student though. Tableau prep is pretty bad ass. Sq
I tend not to use PROC MEANS because I’m a fan of PROC SUMMARY. It’s easy to control class variables in PROC SUMMARY. 
How would that look then? Thank you!
This should get your started if you choose to go this route: PROC SUMMARY DATA= namedataset NWAY; CLASS sitename urban type start_year ; VAR sales distributed redeemed ; OUTPUT OUT= mean(sales)=mSales mean(distributed)=mDistributed &lt;repeat for other variables&gt; Apologies for formatting — I’m on mobile 
Proc means and summary are virtually identical other than the default to create lst output and an output data set or hot. Both can do what you describe.
Try using a CLASS statement instead of a BY statement, and list all of the variables you want to see in the output.
I’m quite stuck in my ways :). I usually use PROC SUMMARY for de-duplication and scrubbing checks, not summary statistics 
&gt;PROC SUMMARY DATA= namedataset NWAY; CLASS sitename urban type start\_year ; VAR sales distributed redeemed ; OUTPUT OUT= mean(sales)=mSales mean(distributed)=mDistributed &lt;repeat for other variables&gt; Awesome, thank you! I got it to work and just added a by statement so I would have the mean for each site name. One more question is how to include site names in the new dataset where I received this warning: &amp;#x200B; "WARNING: A class or frequency variable is missing on every observation. NOTE: The above message was for the following BY group: SiteName=downtown &amp;#x200B;
They are two different tests, one uses Normal distribution and one is chi square. What makes you think they should be identical? 
Doesn't the BY statement make it so the mean for those variables are at the site name level?
For purposes of an analysis like this, the only difference is the format of the output: https://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2018/02/14/difference-class-and-by-statements-sas.html.
You're right they are two different tests, though somewhere in the back of my mind I assumed they would factor out to be the same statistic because they are constrained to a 2x2 table. I've also seen some derivation of chi-square and z-test and their connection. Regarding the parameterization, LSMEAN only works with the ref=GLM option so that is the only way I can get these pairwise tests from PROC LOGISTIC. I'm not interested in the model itself, just a simpler way to do these pairwise tests.
If using the VM it’s using your computer CPU and RAM. You can set the limits for RAM in the VM settings, but are limited to dual core. You can also set the work library to an external location to deal with larger files. 
Reverse the order of your SET statements. And try adding a BY statement that matches your BY/CLASS statement. 
I also answered this for someone else last week, it’s on here somewhere. 
Its showing that those values are character values. Its formating those columns or whatever as characters.
Thanks, and What about those numbers, like 25, 6-23 and 32-34?
If you can't Google the answer to this question, you're on trouble. 
I tried, but wasn't helpful and i found my answer here.
[removed]
They are column number pointers. So Team starts at column 25, Name starts at column 6 and goes to column 23, etc.
This is either a joke or you are very lost. 
SAS UE is free, it runs Base SAS on a VM that you access through your browser with no internet connection required. That may be what you're looking for.
Hello, I can see why youve confused this subreddit but its for sas software and not the SAS military group 
Could you explain that a little more? I apologize for not following along, but my professor made my class do a project in SAS without giving us any formal instruction or SAS textbook, so I'm having trouble following along with the syntax logic.
Also what do you mean by "the SQL here"? 
Reading those fields out of order makes my head hurt.
That's to emphasize what those pointers do. You can mix and match and it doesn't matter the order, it matters the number.
It's SAS. The online resources aren't the best.
 Thank you!! This is giving me a different F value than when I run the HOV test. I think it is taking the deviations from the overall median, not the individual treatment median. Do you know how to do this step?? 
I know you're getting downvoted but I kind of agree. Learning the best way to google something is a good skill to have with anything technical, SAS included. Searching *sas data step $* isn't very helpful. But "Data Step" for SAS is kind of generic, given how much stuff goes into a data step. Instead, looking at a more targeted search - *sas data step input $* \- yields the first result as a thorough write up on the input statement from [sas.com](https://sas.com). Just a bit down the page is the answer to this question &amp;#x200B; &gt; $ &gt; &gt;specifies to store the variable value as a character value rather than as a numeric value. &amp;#x200B; Though not the best, learning to navigate and understand the SAS documentation is very valuable. &amp;#x200B;
It shouldn’t be unless you forgot the group by statement. 
See link above. 
Yes, I know it works, but that doesn't stop the pain in my head.
What /u/a157reverse said. There is no other version, that I am aware of, without paying licensing fees.
Oh I remember the days... not too long ago, where I had to code out an input statement from a DB2 mainframe file that had a width of close to 6000. Need to go dig that script up to see how many fields that came out to be. Had a few others I did as well, but don't remember how long each row was in those files. All were a pain in the ass. Good news is that those scripts are still used today, almost 5 years after I created them.
I'm pretty sure you're keeping those two variables from the data set you're reading in. That drop is weird and I'd need to see some prints to figure it out.
Drop will drop any output variable that starts with an underscore, ie _type_ or _control_ or _freq_ The colon is a shortcut operator to match based on prefixes. Third example here: https://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2018/05/29/6-easy-ways-to-specify-a-list-of-variables-in-sas.html
No it doesn’t. It does exactly what you asked for: 1. Take median of each group 2. Subtract median from each value in group 3. Run ANOVA on residual values What makes you think it’s incorrect? The medians are definitely per group, not overall. 
More details. I suspect you’re misunderstanding something here. 
The code I'm using is: proc reg data=oib_return; model XR = oib_F oib_M oib_C lag_oib_F lag2_oib_F lag3_oib_F lag_oib_M lag2_oib_M lag3_oib_M lag_oib_C lag2_oib_C lag3_oib_C; quit;
Error is not what you think it is. It’s not something you add to the model, its the difference to get you to the actual value, ie residual. It captures the difference between expected and actual values. 
Pretty sure class is your grouping variable and var is your variable of interest. So if class=gender and var=age in proc means you'd get the mean age of males vs females.
There are some really great courses available from SAS directly. I believe their first development class is free these days. I've taken the first two and they were very helpful. Other than paying for 3rd party classes, the best resource is the SAS website itself. 
I thought Lora Delwiche and Susan Slaughter’s The Little SAS Book was a great introduction!
Class **Specifies the variables whose values define the subgroup combinations for the analysis.** [https://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=proc&amp;docsetVersion=9.4&amp;docsetTarget=p0gpxoqczfzcyln13ma53kpq38lo.htm&amp;locale=en](https://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=proc&amp;docsetVersion=9.4&amp;docsetTarget=p0gpxoqczfzcyln13ma53kpq38lo.htm&amp;locale=en) &amp;#x200B; Var **Identifies the analysis variables and their order in the output.** [https://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=proc&amp;docsetVersion=9.4&amp;docsetTarget=p12n9rrav4byvzn1b9wj26dcoq9l.htm&amp;locale=en](https://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=proc&amp;docsetVersion=9.4&amp;docsetTarget=p12n9rrav4byvzn1b9wj26dcoq9l.htm&amp;locale=en) &amp;#x200B; The documentation is quite thorough, I suggest bookmarking the following site: [https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=pgmsascdc&amp;cdcVersion=9.4\_3.4&amp;docsetId=pgmsashome&amp;docsetTarget=home.htm&amp;locale=en](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=pgmsascdc&amp;cdcVersion=9.4_3.4&amp;docsetId=pgmsashome&amp;docsetTarget=home.htm&amp;locale=en)
The [free e-learnings](https://www.sas.com/en_us/training/offers/free-training.html) that SAS offers are a great way to get started, especially the SAS Programming 1: Essentials course. You can use [SAS University Edition](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html) to practice the exercises in the training course. I also highly recommend The Little SAS Book. 
Keep is what variables you read from the input ds. Howevers it does not provide any efficieny the means(and summary) procedure does not benefit from it, like a datastep. Drop. :_ you drop everything from the result set starting with an underscore (if you dont do this the output will have the _TYPE_ and _FREQ_ variables) 
This is not a SAS question. 
Informat is used when you read in variables such as character, date, or numeric, and you need to identify the width of the variable, for example, or how you want variable to appear. You use SAS informats in the DATA step code. For example, if you have date as a variable in your data step code, after the date, you use the informat MMDDYY9. to make the date appear as MM/DD/YY. Mainly, you can think of informats as giving SAS instructions on how to read in data. Formats are instructions for SAS on how to output the data. Formats are used in the PROC PRINT statement. So for example, after reading in your variables in the DATA step your PROC PRINT statement can look something like this. PROC PRINT DATA=info; format date MMDDYY9.; RUN; This will give you the date variable in the format you want but it is done in the proc print statement rather than the data statement. I do not have SAS software available to me at this moment so I apologize for the lack of examples. I hope this helped a bit. Also, the SAS website has tons of informat and format statements to help you choose what is best for your data. 
Thanks man.
That is a great explanation. To clarify, the format statement in a proc only affects the formatting in that proc. The format statement can also be used in a data step to change the format of the underlying data.
Proc datasets?
No, I'm talking about using the format statement in a data step. Then that format will be attached to the variable any time the data set is accessed. It would already be formatted for procs or if the data were just viewed or exported.
Just being pedantic. The statement that a format statement in a Proc only applies to that proc is not true if a format is applied via proc datasets. 
Yes, good point. I don't think I've ever used the format statement there, but that would certainly be more efficient if you weren't already processing the data set with a data step.
The second example will create an output in your default (usually work) library, because no library was specified on the data statement - if it was "data mylib.class\_list;" it would create an excel spreadsheet.
Trying to proc export or proc import? 
Yup, in the data step you’re altering the actual data, so it is called an informat. In the proc print statement you’re only formatting the printed out data you are outputting. So if you decide in your proc statement to only print out 5 observations out of a large data set, a format in the proc statement will only format those 5 observations which you are printing, not the whole data set. 
I think that makes sense. So the Excel file gets assigned to a library in the first example too?
/u/negligiblemass is correct. The libname statement itself isn't enough to ensure that SAS data steps write to the excel file. Referencing the libref "sales" before the datastep name "Sales.q1\_2018" is what tells SAS to write the data step into an Excel worksheet. To write class\_list to excell the data step should have been declared as data mylib.class\_list;
Here is an example to illustrate the difference: a = '20190220'; b = input(a, yymmdd8.); The informat is yymmdd8. When I look at b in the output data set, it will have the value 21600 (the SAS date for yesterday). If I add this format statement to the data step: format b yymmdds10.; Then b displays as 2019/02/20 in the output data set. (However, the actual value in the variable b is still 21600.)
Yep, that's right. The "libname sales xlsx ..." statement creates the connection between SAS and excel, and then writing to the sales library will push data down that pipe.
Awesome!. I only have access to SAS when I am on my university’s campus, which is only twice a week. I cannot get it on my mac I do not have enough storage to download windows through bootcamp to use SAS:(. Thanks for providing an example! 
The first question creates a permanent data set that will appear in the folder you listed on the first line in the LIBNAME statement. That way, you can open the file from the folder whenever you want to since is permanent. 
SAS has an option in some cases for pass through. What this means is it can use sas code and pass it to a database to perform the actions there. Worth noting some functions are available and some are not when it comes to pass through (i.e. iirc Oracle doesn't have strip() as a valid function so you couldn't use it in sas pass through). Is that what you're looking for? 
 I used to use pass through a lot. There is an indirect and direct way. The direct way isn't ways quicker. Its kind of like, you have an opener and closer code then you can create the table and insert the data. 
What's the difference between class and by, as a definition (I know how it alert the results in practice). But why those specific words?
If you're going more towards a traditional stat role (epi,statistician etc), R has a variety of new stat packages. If you're looking for a more machine learning/predictive analytics, then python has a nice ecosystem. 
I work in a risk modeling team at a major bank in the US. My team exclusively uses Python for data modeling. We use SAS for data retreival and some manipulation, but people generally don't like using it for reasons you might understand. Other teams use R instead of Python, we just like using Python more. 
That code only connects to the database. You need to write either your SQL or data step code to update the data set on the server. It depends on your permissions but is something that can be done. 
Could you tell me little bit more? Or what keyword should I google?
SQL update. 
Most larger UK banks are on Sas but moving in the direction of python. Smaller analytics/startup banks are generally on python ime. 
I'd go with Python. I think even SAS sees the writing on the wall. https://github.com/sassoftware/saspy
Learn R or Python. I love SAS, but it is so absurdly expensive to license that you will only ever use it professionally if you happen to go to a company that uses SAS. R and Python cost you nothing to install and use for the base versions. R and Python are also both in higher demand in the job market, based on my experience knowing a lot of SAS and only a bit of R and Python. 
Define yourself by the problems you can solve. Not the tools you use. 
SAS viya is an IDE that integrates python and R with SAS and it’s language base. 
Integrate SAS with R? Or R with SAS? Because my whole thing is having to pay for the SAS license. If there's a way for me to run SAS syntax within the R IDE (or any IDE that isn't super expensive), this would be amazing. 
Absolutely. Knowing more tools is definitely better, all else being equal, but problem solving ability is invaluable in the job market.
Okay. You need proc SQL. You'll need to use a connect statement to your server, a pass-through create table statement to house the data in a SQL table, and an insert statement to load the data from your sas dataset into that table.
One is not necessarily better than the other. The way I like to explain it is that R was created as a statistical programming language that has added stuff over the years, while python is a general purpose programming language that has added statistics and data science over time. R seems to have received a really bad wrap the last few years, and most the comments i see about this come from the data science community. As long as you are not trying to do web development or programming apps/software, then R is no different than python. If you have no plans to need python for anything else besides data analysis, data science, data visualization, the try out R. By the way RStudio 1.2 has python support! My comapny is a heavy SAS shop, and I made the transition to R pretty easy. CDO is interested in our work because if we moved to R or python he wouldn't have to spend millions a year on SAS.
Just drop SAS entirely and pick up R using tidyverse. Great transition if you ever used proc SQL.
Also if you used proc SQL in SAS then the transition to R via the tidyverse (specifically the dplyr package) will be an EASY transition.
I'm assuming by assigning directory it's the libname statement. [https://support.sas.com/software/products/university-edition/faq/SAS\_libname.htm](https://support.sas.com/software/products/university-edition/faq/SAS_libname.htm)
I use R already, but I don't get as much of an opportunity to use it as SAS, because work. That said, I would like to leave my current job, so anything that helps me learn R better is welcome 
Yes. After that instruction it says LIBNAME hw3 “(lists location and has her last name after user)”; how do I change that? I’m sorry I’m sure this is super easy and stupid, this class is just a core class for my program. I’m terrible with computers/programs. Last semester we used a different program. I see on SAS studio where I can create a new library, I just don’t know what to input in each box (name, path, options) and if I have everything else saved right. I just saved the provided dataset to a folder on my desktop I had to create when I downloaded the program (named SASUniversityEdition). Inside that folder, a folder named ‘myfolders.’ I just saved the data set inside that folder. 
Are you on Windows? I'm confused as to what you're asking. You have a LIBNAME statement as the first line of your SAS program. Which looks like: LIBNAME hw3 "/path/to/sas/library" So in your case (if you're on Windows) you'd change this to: LIBNAME hw3 "C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\Desktop\SASUniversityEdition\myfolders" 
Yup. I find people who argue about the tools they know to really not know much. 
Yup! Just to add I find people who argue about tools to really not know much. 
Take the free SAS Programming 1 e learning course on their training page. The first few chapters should dive into the topics you need.
I am using a Mac. I guess I understand that I’ll put that in the first line of my SAS program, I’m just confused on if I’m not saving the file I downloaded from my teacher correctly. The file is saved under the (data name).sas7bdat. On SAS studio I thought I had to save this to my library, but wasn’t sure how I’d fill out the new library window. I didn’t know if adding the file to the library was the part where I’d need to assign directory or if that’s just the one change I’ll make while writing LIBNAME statement. I’m sorry I literally have always been terrible with computers. I know I need to take some basic courses and get better at it. Just feel like I’m running out of time. I have a few pictures I can show if it would help explaining this less frustrating. 
I’ll try this after work. Just feel like I’m not understanding something SUPER simple, so I feel like it’s not covered in training videos lol. 
It sounds like the instructor is telling you to save the data set to your own area, and you seem to have done that. Another way to do the same is to create two libnames -- one for the teacher's folder and one for yours. Then write the data set to yours by using a data step. Here is what that would look like: data mydir.dset; set classdir.dset; run;
No worries, took me a minute. All the libname statement is doing is telling SAS where the data is located, then gives that location a libref or ’nickname’. For example, LIBNAME pg1 “c:/documents/data”; tells SAS all my SAS tables are in that location.
Sorry to hear about the BF. You can PM me the code if you'd like. I can direct you to what I think are the best sources to learn true programming in SAS, but that's probably less imperative at the moment for you.
Ah, I think I just figured out what you mean. So you've installed VirtualBox and are running SAS Studio on localhost:10080 through your web browser? On the first screen you see (before you click "Start SAS Studio"), do you see any messages in the bottom right under "Notifications"?
pushing whole new dataset
Are you familiar with SAS or SQL? If you set it up as a libname, and you have the correct permissions you can treat it as a SAS library and write directly to it. This would copy a file from work and place it on the server. Proc copy in = work out = myDB; Select myDBTable; Run:quit;
I am familiar with Sas! Let me try this!!
Yep, using studio and running it through the browser. Only thing under notifications: ‘SAS university edition is up to date’ 
I use datacamp, but I have found good resources on udemy and linked in learning. It you can get it covered by work, matt dancho's business analytics in R is a great course but a bit more expensive. You pay for what you get though ;)
https://imgur.com/a/X5ycNgp
I am familiar with Sas! &amp;#x200B; And I tried this, but how does this have to do with pushing sas data to sql server? The table I exported doesn't show up in sql server. 
Fair! I've been slowly working through the free R course in datacamp. I also noticed that Harvard offers an online R course with a certificate for $55, so I'll probably do that next. 
SAS Programming 1 is F[REE online](https://support.sas.com/edu/schedules.html?ctry=us&amp;crs=prog1) and they have a version that corresponds with SAS Studio. It's all about getting your data into SAS and set up.
To expound on this: Club2 is what's being created. The input statement is defining the field, field type, and length of what's in club2. The datalines code is filling club2 with data in the order of the fields listed on the input line. Proc print just shows the data in the output window and adds the title listed.
The healthcare, pharmaceutical, and banking industries all use SAS. Go to indeed and just search for jobs using SAS as a keyword. You'll get a good idea of what's out there.
The out library is the server and it should write the data to the server, assuming you have write permissions. 
Right! If there's no messages there, then it means you've successfully mounted the SASUniversityEdition/myfolders folder. All you need to do is in the Code section type: LIBNAME hw3 "/folders/myfolders"; And then click on the running man. The log should say: NOTE: Libref HW3 was successfully assigned as follows: Engine: V9 Physical Name: /folders/myfolders/ Then to check: in the Code section you run: PROC PRINT DATA=hw3.lead2; RUN; And it should display your dataset. And then all the rest of the code in the assignment should now work. 
It's used for console/log output, e.g. from PROC FREQ, to ensure the 'borders' and 'lines' look like lines.
The '||' are concantenation operators. &amp;#x200B; So the result will look something like 3(2.2%) depending on the values of TRT (dataset value) and &amp;TRT (macro variable). &amp;#x200B; I assume it's returning the TRT value, and the % of that value out of the total of TRT. &amp;#x200B;
Here are some examples: http://www.sascommunity.org/wiki/FORMCHAR_Option.
Thanks for this question and these replies!
YAY! I can do my homework, haha. Thank you so much! Seriously. This whole program to me is like a new world and I was having such a hard time just getting started. Thank you thank you thank you!
Thank you! I finally got the homework portion figured out, but would gladly accept any advice for future SAS programming. I have A LOT of learning to do haha. 
Sure, do you already know how to program?
It’s not anymore. It’s only useful if you use the listing/only text output and want to copy and paste that into a report. Any of the other output formats do not require this. 
Those appear to be separate statements that are not related. 
The PDV is what really threw me off when I took SAS Programming 1 &amp; 2. Thanks for the links!
Following
Enterprise Guide will automatically indent for you if you push Ctrl+I
And comment it. 
I would highly recommend contacting your teacher and letting them know of the situation. They are likely to have an available consultation time to talk through the content, and they are usually much happier to talk to someone who wants to learn the material but has run into problems, than to see you flunk out because you tried to muddle through it by yourself. There may even be some leeway to either extend the assignment deadline or give you some other consideration.
As pointed out, the || just join the things together, so the first line is taking a few different things and lining them up together in the string called "Active". Those things are: * put(trt1,2.) which is the value in trt1 formatted as a 2-digit number * '(' which is hopefully self-explanatory * put(trt1/&amp;trt1*100,5.1) which is the value in trt1, divided by the value in the *macro variable* trt1 (which is presumably set to some kind of total value for trt1), times 100, formatted as 5.1 (so essentially expressed as a 5-character-long percentage including 1 decimal point) * '%' and ')' which could have been put together as a single '%)' So it basically creates a string with the value of trt1, followed by what percentage it is in parentheses. For example, if trt1 = 50 and &amp;trt1 = 75, then you would get 50(66.7%)
Yeah I should have done this a week and a half ago. Just felt pathetic to do it so many weeks after class had started. Definitely planning on consulting them and the TAs for the remainder of the semester until I feel more caught up. Thanks! :)
I don’t at all! Thanks for posting that. I will for sure look through those :)
Don't beat yourself up too much about it, things happen. (I wrote off an entire semester of my degree due to personal issues, but I firmly believe I'm better off for it having happened.) Just drop a note to your lecturer / TA to say "Hey, I had some personal issues in the first few weeks of class and I've been trying to catch up on my own, but I think I need some guidance. Is there any chance I can meet up and talk through where I'm struggling with you?" In any case, good luck with your class! It sounds like you have every intention of getting through this, and with that attitude I'm sure you'll come out the other side in a much better position.
We give a practice exercise for candidates to complete before the second interview, although I’ve also heard of interviewers handing candidates code and asking them to explain it during the interview, and others might ask for a code sample. I would recommend being able to describe what procs you use, what types of data you’re familiar with working with (e.g., longitudinal data, survey data, etc.), and your experience/approach with data cleaning. It would be a good idea to skim through any old code of yours that you have lying around to be able to explain what you did, and prepare for hypothetical “how would you approach this problem” questions. 
We Use a take home exercise, TCB Analytics One Size Fits All interview process. If you can do that usually you’re up to par for what we need. 
Commenting for review later...
Thanks for the guide, so I can pass to new teammates and interns. I have lots of links like this I just never took the time to review and organize. Awesome of you to do this for the group. I agree on the PDV. Also it's good to know how when certain processes and data steps should be used. I know on our team PROC SQL is used as a transition, and the later as a crutch to hold onto. Not saying PROC SQL is bad, but it is not always the best way and it is good to know 1. How to code in base SAS and 2. When you should code in base SAS.
SAS Academics on Demand - free for non commercial usage, cloud based. Select the independent learner option. You do not need to be an academic or student to use it. 
Use proc means instead. For binary variables, teo shortcuts are: * Sum = # of 1 * Mean = % of 1 * N = # of observations * You can data about 0s by subtraction 
I don’t know how I didn’t think of this. Thanks! 
No problem! Getting your environment up and running is always the hard part because most tutorials will either gloss over it or miss it out entirely. Best of luck with your homework - you'll be caught up in no time.
A lot of code I've seen uses PROC SQL to do things where a data step would be easier, more performant, more readable, and more flexible. My personal choice is to use the data step with an explicit loop for anything complicated, and leave SQL only for basic SQL joins/groupbys/SELECT INTO macros, etc. Lately I've been doing this from PROC DS2 actually, which I feel is superior, but it's still essentially the data step. I especially like doing merges this way. Without using the merge keyword, as I can control precisely how observations and variables in different data sets will interact. But by far the worst code I've seen uses the implicit data step loop in conjunction with the Retain keyword and lag functions. These can easily make a program unreadable.
thanks! looks like it is working well for me, was able to score my file via an http endpoint. bit challenging interpreting the json result though still figuring that out!
Libname JSON?
i've found that but not a ton of examples, my json looks like this: &amp;#x200B; {"data":\[{"predictionValues":\[{"value":0.1234847921,"label":1.0},{"value":0.8765152079,"label":0.0}\],"predictionThreshold":0.5,"prediction":0.0,"rowId":0,"passthroughValues":{"PassengerId":"892"}},{"predictionValues":\[{"value":0.2789450715,"label":1.0},{"value":0.7210549285,"label":0.0}\],"predictionThreshold":0.5,"prediction":0.0,"rowId":1,"passthroughValues":{"PassengerId":"893"}},{"predictionValues":\[{"value":0.07836511,"label":1.0},{"value":0.92163489,"label":0.0}\],"predictionThreshold":0.5,"prediction":0.0,"rowId":2,"passthroughValues":{"PassengerId":"894"}},{"predictionValues":\[{"value":0.1152529233,"label":1.0},{"value":0.8847470767,"label":0.0}\],"predictionThreshold":0.5,"prediction":0.0,"rowId":3,"passthroughValues":{"PassengerId":"895"}},{"predictionValues":\[{"value":0.4283788699,"label":1.0},{"value":0.5716211301,"label":0.0}\],"predictionThreshold":0.5,"prediction":0.0,"rowId":4,"passthroughValues":{"PassengerId":"896"}}\]} &amp;#x200B; code: &amp;#x200B; proc print [data=response.data](https://data=response.data); &amp;#x200B; prints out ordinal root (1), ordinal data (1-5), predictionThreshold, prediction, and rowId - but i'm not sure how to go in and pull down one of the predictionValues i want (label 1.0) nor the passthroughValues passenger id.

Determine the type of analysis you want to do, find the appropriate procedure in SAS and then check the documentation for examples with the data sets. 
Why? 97MB would be trivial to deal with in SAS. 
I feel so dumb that I didn’t think of it. Thanks!!! 
function() is a non-sas process that deals only with smaller chunks
You could do this in a [MACRO](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/mcrolref/61885/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a003167027.htm) loop using the [FIRSTOBS](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/ledsoptsref/63326/HTML/default/viewer.htm#p0wjxoxrco6dsgn1ls5n3mbybcng.htm) and [OBS](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/ledsoptsref/63326/HTML/default/viewer.htm#p0h5nwbig8mobbn1u0dwtdo0c0a0.htm) data set options. Or using a WHERE statement and the [\_N\_](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrcon/62955/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a000695104.htm) automatic variable. Of course, this is all using the number of records. %Macro Chunks() ; %Do start = 1 %to 10,000 %by 100 ; %let end = %eval(&amp;start + 99) ; Data Chunked ; Set Big (firstobs = &amp;start obs = &amp;end) ; Run ; [Whatever other code] %end ; %mend Chunks ; %Chunks(); Assuming you know macros, you get the gist. 
Split the file once it’s in SAS and call the other process via CALL SYSTEM then I suppose. Split file by number of records is more common than by size. 
The file format makes a big difference. Is it a SAS data set, an Excel spreadsheet, some other proprietary format? Or is it just a text file? If it's a text file, does it have line feeds/carriage returns? If it is a normal text file, I'd agree with others who said it's better to split it by number of records (within the size constraint). Be sure to use the "CHARn" informat so that you maintain leading blanks. Alternatively, if it's a Unix/Linux system, you can use the "split" command.
I'm not following your question. If you want to stick with PROC FREQ, you can do something like this: proc freq data=\_data; table var / out=new\_table(where=(var = 1)); run; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
I'm not following what you're saying about how the retain or lag functions make code unreadable. This is likely personal preference, but I don't have any problems following what they are doing. I hesitate to mention anything because this is such a subjective discussion, but I want anyone coming along in the future to know that there are certainly multiple viewpoints on subjects like this. &amp;#x200B;
Using SAS to parse JSON was new to me and I really question the usefulness of the JSON libname argument because I think you are exactly right, the order of the JSON determines how the document is parsed. This is from the documentation: &gt; Set the TABLEPATH to /root/info/phone to get an observation after a phone object is encountered. Your data is not in an order where it can simply be read and parsed cleanly into a dataset in one step, but you can still put together the pieces with a little work. Start off with the libname statement and run PROC DATASETS on what it parses: libname passage JSON "passengers.json" map="auto.map" automap=create; proc datasets lib=passage; run; Your file produces four datasets: 1 ALLDATA DATA 2 DATA DATA 3 DATA_PASSTHROUGHVALUES DATA 4 DATA_PREDICTIONVALUES DATA The interesting thing is that the automatically created ordinal_data variable looks like a useful key variable between all three datasets. A little SQL puts the data together: proc sql; select d3.PassengerId, d1.prediction, d1.predictionThreshold, d2.label, d2.value from passage.data d1, passage.data_predictionValues d2, passage.data_passthroughValues d3 where (d1.ordinal_data eq d2.ordinal_data) and (d1.ordinal_data eq d3.ordinal_data) order by d3.PassengerId, d2.label; quit; Produces: prediction PassengerId prediction Threshold label value --------------------------------------------------------- 892 0 0.5 0 0.876515 892 0 0.5 1 0.123485 893 0 0.5 0 0.721055 893 0 0.5 1 0.278945 894 0 0.5 0 0.921635 894 0 0.5 1 0.078365 895 0 0.5 0 0.884747 895 0 0.5 1 0.115253 896 0 0.5 0 0.571621 896 0 0.5 1 0.428379 So good question! It took a little bit of digging to figure out. As a personal opinion, I would infinitely prefer to work with JSON using python. Having a program to convert JSON files into the flat file format that SAS prefers seems like the way to go.
thanks! i was hoping i was missing something on the TABLEPATH, but perhaps SAS handling of json is simply not as flexible as one would hope yet; i have had a good experience using json\_serialize on python to perform a similar task. the above certainly accomplishes the task and does it well, thanks!
hmm. i suppose it is a csv or sas7bdat, though in my case, the former.
As I said in a post a few weeks ago: &gt; Since it was built in the 60s, it has a lot of quirks that make more sense if you think about how computing was done in the 60s. The DATA steps operate on one row of data at a time, because they used to run on punchcards where it was hard to move back and forth in the data quickly; and the DATALINES / CARDS statements also come from the same source. Similarly, many of the base-level PROCs do stuff that can be easily handled by holding a few pieces of data in memory. &gt; The SAS Macro language is similarly quite powerful, but only in the sense of being an automated text-production language. You write the macro code, then the Macro interpreter turns that into text, then the main SAS interpreter tries to read that text like code.
Create a format for your age groups and proc means. Proc means will apply the format for your age groups and generate the output data set desired. If it’s a displayed report, proc tabulate works. I’m not typing out your data but if you need an example of how this works I have some on GitHub, DM me for link. 
If you're using ODS to send an email along with proc report to send a dataset, you'll use this depending on the version of Outlook being used. It helps with html formatting
I agree. There are 1000 ways to do the same thing. Some may be better than others, but that's neither here nor there.
Well, since the source file is almost 100mb I'd assume you'd be able to divide the total records in your dataset by 10 to get roughly the number of records for yer 10mb datasets. Something bare bones like this would work: Data table1 table2 table3 table4 table5 table6 table7 table8 table9 table10; Set input_file; If _n_ &lt; x then output table1; If _n_ &gt;= x and _n_ &lt;= x then output table2; If _n_ &gt;= x and _n_ &lt;= x then output table3; Etc.... you should get the idea. run;
This article points to an even better python option: [Flattening JSON objects in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/flattening-json-objects-in-python-f5343c794b10). Dealing with arbitrarily complex nested data structures is challenging in SAS, but I am still surprised that the json libname depends on the physical order of items in the code. This definitely seems like a case where pre-processing it in python, perhaps even using [SASPy](https://github.com/sassoftware/saspy) makes sense.
I agree, and yes it is a personal preference to stay away from those. However, what I was saying wasn't that they are intrinsically bad, but that the worst code I've seen used them and was very difficult to analyze largely because the logic depended on those keywords.
First Google search result. I verified it works. Come on, now. At least try a little. https://communities.sas.com/t5/ODS-and-Base-Reporting/Why-SAS-email-attachment-works-for-CSV-file-but-not-xlsx/td-p/198538
Mind posting your code? 
Let me try this...I did research and tried something similar but not quite this
Fair enough. I sent myself and others on multiple servers an Excel sheet with and without the explicit content_type tag. It corrupted without, delivered successfully with
ods excel file="&lt;file name .xlsx&gt;"; ods excel close; options emailsys=smtp emailhost=smtp.&lt;org - email smtp&gt;emailport=&lt;#&gt;; filename mailit email to='&lt;outgoing email&gt;' from='&lt;email&gt;' subject="TEST" attach=("&lt;file name .xlsx&gt;" content_type="application/xlsx"); run; data _null_; file mailit; put "TEST"; run; It works now...I had to add the content_type =“application/xlsx” 
This is awesome. Thanks!!! Do you possibly know if you can send an e-mail attaching an Ods tagsets.htmlpanel When it generates a report in “c:\temp”
I haven't tried to send a .html personally, but I don't see any reason why it couldn't. Anything that you can attach to an email SAS should be able to handle.
Here you go. You can also use proc report to send a dataset if you wanted. Filename temp email To =(emails separated by space) CC=(emails separated by space) BCC=(emails separated by space) Subject = "Something" Type = "text/html" Attach(filepath\file.ext); Data _ null _; File temp; Run; 
Do HTML5, not HTML, HTML files need too many supports around them. 
Are there any lines in there that stand out as being possibly wrong? Any forgotten semicolons, or wrongly used punctuation marks, or misspelled commands?
Where’s the question from? You sure you copied it correctly?
I'm not sure what the parentheses do. I think the hyphens are a header: http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/proc/61895/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a002473625.htm. There's some more good background on proc report here: http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/proc/61895/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a000146851.htm#a002473614. I try to avoid proc report when I can, but it can be very powerful if you want to be able to customize your report.
First, I have no idea what this data step is trying to accomplish. Second, I think it may abend due to syntax since the array name refers to a variable that exists in the data step (after the retain statement).
Think you may have the wrong group. This is for SAS, the statistical analysis programming language.
Create a sample dataset with basic values and run the code? See what happens and then understand why one of A-D is the answer and why the others are not the answer. 
The parenthesis group columns together with the header. If you instead had... column Ord _name_ Active ('--' Placebo Overall); ...the header would only include the columns Placebo and Overall. There would be no header for the other columns.
Thanks. That makes sense. At least I got the header part right. I just wanted to share what I knew to get the ball rolling.
That’s incorrect, you can use find/index/substr in proc sql. 
a fuzzy match would probably work but there's a more precise way to do it. here's what i'd suggest: 1. parse the string in dataset A into separate columns, setting N columns to the max number of delimiters (|) in a single row of dataset A. 2. left join B to A on column 1, then column 2, then column 3, etc. does this make sense? 
Should be in your pred data set, not in there? Does the log show an error?
Off the top of my head, try: &amp;#x200B; proc logistic data=x; model y=x1 x2 x3; output out=pred predicted=pred\_variable; run;
I do not get an error in log but I get the results. [https://imgur.com/a/ePoP2UB](https://imgur.com/a/ePoP2UB)

That’s correct, P0 is probability of 0, p1 is probability of 1 and then you have the confidence intervals. What are you expecting that you’re not getting?
What makes you think think something is wrong? 
I think it's the interpretation of the output. You cleared up what p_0 and p_1 is. How do I interpret the rest of the output. Thanks.
In terms of what? It’s a prediction with the confidence interval. 
I think I understand it now. So it gives me a prediction for 0 and 1 and then a set of confidence intervals for both 0 and 1 which is why there is two upper and lower limits. Thank you so much for your help.
I don’t think you have to create the variables yourself the procedure should do it for you. Add a class statement before the model statement and it should create dummy variables for you and give ORs for each level be the referent group as well as versus the other groups. You can change the referent group in the class statement. Proc logistic data=libname.name; Class &lt;predictor&gt; (ref=‘A’); Model outcome = predictor; Run; 
Ideally, I’d like a double stacked bar graph that entertain two measures and shared to the same group (product) plotted against month category.... All ideas entertained!!!! Thanks in advance.
VA or Base?
Thanks! I am in VA version 7.4
Any recommendations for me???
Sorry, no. I’m not familiar with VA, only Base. 
Something to keep in mind as you play around with this (and honest, no offense, but this is something you can answer for yourself if you tried joining using a SUBSTR function in a PROC SQL query) is that your performance for the join might really suffer. If you try joining on a.var = substr(b.var,1,3), PROC SQL has to process the substr on every row to determine if it's a match. You are essentially doing a Cartesian (cross) join and then using a subsetting WHERE clause - which is often very inefficient from a processing standpoint. It might even be prohibitive depending on the size of your data and the environment where you're accessing the data. So while you can use SUBSTR in a join, for example, the real question is whether there's a better or more efficient way to run that query. Maybe your data is set up as such that it doesn't matter. But it might. And good habits are good to know, even if best practice isn't always needed.
I am not so sure if the categories are ordinal.
Doesn’t matter. That affects interpretation not coding. 
thanks, this looks about something that i would need, although ultimately i think if the process requires something like this, a non-sas environment ends up being more suitable, so i probably will not end up advising work be done via SAS when large amounts of data need be run through this process.
Essentially you need the computer it is setup on to be able to be accessed on port 10080(I think). I think the default NAT setup is ok for virtual box to do this. May need to setup para virtualized. Setup the local IP to be static at the modem or router...wherever the DCHP assignment is. So say that computers ip is 192.168.0.130. You need to be able to access http://192.168.0.130:10080 from the other computer browsers Maybe work out of the box or have to some port forwarding 
Best thing to do is find out the DNS or IP address of your mail server, and send email from SAS directly over SMTP. [https://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings/pdfs/sgf2008/038-2008.pdf](https://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings/pdfs/sgf2008/038-2008.pdf) &amp;#x200B; options [emailhost=smtp.mycompany.net](https://emailhost=smtp.mycompany.net) emailsys=smtp ;
I don't think there is anything free besides university edition, or access through work if you are lucky. I am curious, what don't you like about the university edition?
Is it everything? Can I tell an employer I programmed on the university rdition and they will believe me?
here is how i would do it: 1) process dataset a to where there is one serial per row (retain) the "serials" column such that the whole string is associated with each individual row containing the component serial. 2) merge in the dataset B by this new component serial. 3) drop the column with the component serial. 
No one expects you to have worked with everything sas sells. That's hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of software. University edition includes base, stat and iml. This closely approximates the most common desktop package (analytics pro) which they sell. I think you will find that it gives you a lot to get started. &amp;#x200B; I also recommend their free online class to get started.
What SAS modules do developers at companies use? So it's basically the same language and syntax but ran in diff module at commercial environment?
This depends on the industry, but yes, syntax and language are the same, and university edition is plenty to get started.
If you’re programming it doesn’t matter. The code is about 99% the same, the major difference is how to specify paths because it depends if you’re on a server or not. But working with SAS UE is closer to working with a server install. The GUI varies between EG and SAS Studio, but are similar. You can play with the task to understand how a process flow works but that should be enough. For SAS VA you can have a 14/30 day trial, but I would recommend getting familiar with Base SAS first. And take the courses. 
Whats a good course for getting base certificate? Do you think a non coder / developer can master this?
Sure, as long as you’re willing to learn. Coursera has a starter course you can try or the free SAS ones. Then you can use the SAS prep guide. Someone posted their list of papers on here last week, that they found helpful. 
I torrented a SAS 9.3 windows version. The SID is expired. Anyone know how to spoof it? Changing the PC date didn't help.
I started using SAS five months ago and i studied business law. i work in a funny position but use SAS almost every day. courses are fine but what helped me the most was just to use it. and when i needed help google it.
Why when you have access to a free version? Also 9.3 doesn’t have a lot of the features you’d want to test, like ods excel, or awesome maps. 9.3 is also 7/8 years old. I mean you can learn on it but seems like a stupid decision when you have access to fully functioning free versions. 
Thanks. Everyone steals when they need to learn. Do you think all those people who learned Photoshop, programming, CAD learned it on paid copies? Do you think college and hs kids can afford it? What people do is learn it on stolen copies and then once the skill is acquired, they get a job at place and have them buy it. 
Thanks for letting me know your purpose. It helps to determine whether it’s worth time to support a person or not. 
Nope. Keeping track of what macro variables exist and what's in them is not a strong point for SAS. Really the best approach I know of is to use a %put statement after each macro variable declaration so at least the contents are printed to the log if you need to review them.
Using %PUT \_ALL\_; should work. https://v8doc.sas.com/sashtml/macro/z1071862.htm
Thanks for the tip I’ll start doing that. I like inspecting log files anyway so this should not be too much extra trouble
EG does have this functionality - not sure what OP is using.
Good tip, thanks! I haven't used that before.
I use EG constantly. Which menu or whatever is this under? I haven't found it....
Huh. Apparently there's an EG task out there I didn't know about. https://blogs.sas.com/content/sasdummy/2011/11/22/inspecting-sas-macro-variables-in-sas-enterprise-guide/
We need significantly more details if you need help. 
It sounds like you may want an array, but I agree with the other person who said that we need more information to know for sure.
You're welcome!
Check out SASHELP.VMACRO table. Problem is, it has all macro variables including automatic and system macro variables so it's a pain to filter what you need. &amp;#x200B; Otherwise, variables don't really exist in 'open code' outside a data step. If you're referencing IML, perhaps the DEBUG option is what you need?
Says it's under Tools menu if you're on EG 7.1+. If earlier, it's a custom task add in, that you need admin privileges for. But you can see this information in sashelp.vmacro table. 
If you're using a data step in base SAS, you can use the debug feature to step through your code in chunks (or even one line at a time): `data work.mySet / debug;` `/*data step code here*/` `run;` &amp;#x200B; Then, you can use stuff like: * watch n - this pauses the code every time the value of the variable n changes and tells you the new value. * examine n - tells you the current value of n (I believe before the current line executes) * examine \_all\_ - tells you the current value of all variables * step 10 - runs the next 10 lines of code (replace 10 with whatever number you want) * \[press enter\] - runs the current line of code
Wow I didn’t know about this feature!
What data set(s) is it asking for?
Its asking for cars - I've tried importing it from the help library but even the predefined scripts (i.e. answers to the exercises) don't work with cars imported this way.
So this does not work? &amp;#x200B; `Data work.cars;` `set sashelp.cars;` `run;`
Cars is a default table in the sashelp library. Sashelp.cars
Yes, it sounds like a different language would be better. Certainly would be more efficient. 
You’re likely doing something wrong, please show your code. 
Formats. 
Using "across" in proc report can do this: http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/forum2008/265-2008.pdf
You could use proc format if they're long (vertical) values. If you have a bunch of data and are trying to convert from long to wide, use arrays (eg group1-group3), retain the arrays before the set statement, lock them in with ifs on a do loop, then if all 3 are in the PDV use an explicit output. 
 General code : Proc import datafile “**path**” out = **libname.dataname** dbms = **format** ; getnames = **X** ; run ; Details : Bold words can take values according to your preferences Example of path - /sasfolders/xyz/sasdata/xyz.csv Example of libname.dataname - work.xyz Example of format - csv, xls etc X can take only two values - Yes or No dependent on whether you want first row as headers or not. You can get more info at [Best SAS course in Noida](http://pythonandmltrainingcourses.com/courses/best-sas-training-institute-in-noida/). 
Here is the example code provided from SAS (i have not edited this) in the data they instruct to download for the course: /*SP4R03s01*/ /*Part A*/ data sp4r.cars; set sp4r.cars; mpg_average = mean(mpg_city,mpg_highway); run; /*Part B*/ proc print data=sp4r.cars (obs=5); var mpg_city mpg_highway mpg_average; run; However, as I mentioned CARS is not included in the sp4r library that they provide. Files for the next chapter, for example, are present and the example code runs fine. I am confused why there wasn't a dataset cars in this download. I tried exporting cars from sashelp.cars and then importing into my sp4r library, but the above code doesn't work. For what it is worth I'm using the university edition with a virtual box to run SAS studio.
Thank you, I tried this and it worked. data sashelp.cars; set sashelp.cars; mpg_average = mean(mpg_city,mpg_highway); run; I'm just confused as this is not the answer that is given by SAS (see a reply below) and it thus seems to me there is an error in their course. The issue seems to be that the CARS data should be in my sp4r datafiles which I downloaded.
Create categories 
Change set ....; to Set sashelp.cars;
In a data step, create a variable t = _n_;
Use `libname xlsx` to do this: https://blogs.sas.com/content/sasdummy/2015/05/20/using-libname-xlsx-to-read-and-write-excel-files/
Thanks a lot. I think I will your third and fifth suggestion. &gt; Use `libname xlsx` to do this: &gt; &gt; https://blogs.sas.com/content/sasdummy/2015/05/20/using-libname-xlsx-to-read-and-write-excel-files/ Well this doesn't say anything about writing to a range of cells. Apprently it only starts writing form the cell A1. &gt; &gt; If that doesn't do it and you can use xls instead of xlsx, `libname excel` might work: &gt; &gt; https://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings/proceedings/sugi31/024-31.pdf &gt; Again, this one seems to start writing in the cell A1. But at least they give a workaround: &gt; &gt; To write data beginning elsewhere than default cell A1, first specify an empty named range in Excel. &gt; &gt; Honesty I find this to be a poor hack. (in fact currently I am employing another lousy hack: I build the entire sheet as a SAS dataset containing only character fields and using empty cells as padding between Excel ranges.) &gt; Also worth a look: &gt; &gt; http://www.sascommunity.org/wiki/A_Poor/Rich_SAS_Users_Proc_Export This I will try. &gt; Install R and call R from SAS to do it: &gt; &gt; https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Programming/How-do-you-update-named-range-with-xlsx-engin/m-p/279845/highlight/true#M56445 &gt; Wow! I didn't expect this. Interesting although unfortunately I can't use it as the machine I use for SAS doesn't have access to R. &gt; If all else fails: &gt; https://www.lexjansen.com/pharmasug-cn/2016/PS/PharmaSUG-China-2016-PS08.pdf &gt; This looks good too. In fact it exactly deals with my situation. 
The SAS Ad in for Microsoft Office could do this using a Stored Process.
You can use libname and proc datasets to do this. Just name the range you want to export to in Excel. Libname workbook Excel "file path\file.xlsx" scan_text = no; Proc datasets lib = workbook; Delete named_range; Run; Quit; Proc Append base = workbook.named_range data = export_data; Run; Libname workbook clear;
You're probably right. &amp;#x200B; Just a heads up, you shouldn't store stuff in a library in which you haven't set up as your own for a number of reasons; data work.cars; set sashelp.cars; run; or data mylib.cars; set sashelp.cars; run; /*this would require &lt;libname mylib 'mypath'&gt;*/ differs from: data sashelp.cars; set sashelp.cars; run; The latter option is inferior as you overwrite the dataset which you are reading from, and its a huge inconvenience if you do something wrong and it cannot be corrected. With 'sashelp' its probably not a problem as I would assume they prohibit you from writing to that library. You should see a warning message in the log at least.
&gt; Just name the range in Excel. I can't because it would require that I examine the Excel sheet prior to each export. This is not practical as the size of the exported dataset is not a fixed size. So I prefer to calculate the size of the Excel range in SAS and specify the range as an Excel region like B1:C2.
Just a small warning - the example table you've posted has non-exclusive boundaries (e.g. it looks like a 25-year-old will be counted in both the 2nd and 3rd columns). Assuming that you're going to do analysis (or even reporting) such that the categories sum to the total, make sure that your groupings are mutually exclusive (no overlap) and exhaustive (no gaps).
Sorry, I guess I'm not following you here. I don't know what you mean by &gt;I prefer to calculate the size of the Excel range in SAS and specify the range Once you name the range in Excel it won't matter if the size of the SAS dataset changes. Can you elaborate more on what you're trying to do specifically?
&gt; Once you name the range in Excel it won't matter if the size of the SAS dataset changes. Oh, I didn't know this. So in your example whether export_data has 10 rows or 100 rows all of those rows will be written to the Excel range named_range and Excel somehow stretches the dimension of named_range to fit the dataset? I will try this. &gt; Can you elaborate more on what you're trying to do specifically? In the simplest form I am trying to regularly (let's say weekly) export two data sets d1 and d2 to an existing Excel workbook on the *same* worksheet. The dataset d1 should be written to the cell range B2:Cn where n&gt;2 is a number that changes every week. The data set d2 should be written to the cell range B(n+2):C(n+m+2) where m&gt;0 is also a number that changes every week. 
The benefit of a named range means you don't have to worry about the dimensions. So, I can't say I understand what your trying to do with your ranges but as long as they don't overlap on your worksheet you shouldn't have any issues. Just add another proc dataset/append statement before the libname clear line for your other range and you should be all set. I use this export method all the time.
Yes, and proc format will create an error with overlapping ranges.
If your company pays for it.
It’s an awesome experience, but you have to be social. You’ll learn about things you didn’t know existed. 
Or if you can get one of the [awards](https://www.sas.com/en_us/events/sas-global-forum/program/awards-academic-programs.html#new-sas-professional-award) SAS gives out for people to attend. Depending on the award (and whether or not you can get an abstract accepted at the conference) it could pay for most of the cost of attending.
You can look at the [session catalog](http://sasgfsessioncatalog.com/#/filter/) and filter by job role, topic, skill level, etc. That should give you an idea of the types of topics that will be covered in the breakout sessions. There are sessions for all different types of roles and levels of experience. 
I’ve been 3 times. Worth it. 
Honestly...no. It's a cool experience, and I'm not saying you shouldn't go (sorry for the double negatives). In my experience, the Global Forum really excels as a networking event. From a content perspective, I've had better luck learning industry-applicable content at smaller/regional conferences. Especially those that are industry specific. Since it's the largest SAS conference, it has to appeal to the widest audience. That means the topics covered are all over the place. You might get lucky and find a couple that really appeal to you. But in my experience, most of them were fine, but not great. Plus, all the white papers are published online. I think you'll get more bang for your buck if you go to the global conference when you're a bit more seasoned. You'll get a wider selection of courses that might appeal to you. Plus, once you're more seasoned you can really take advantage of the networking aspect. For now, I would suggest sticking to regional or industry-specific conferences. 
Your code is hard to read, could you post .SAS and log files? Without SAS in front of me I think the problem is with your keep statements, try using the keep data step option instead on your Data step statement. Using the statement is giving you errors because your renamed variables aren't in the pdv yet.
Thank you so much for replying! I actually added a merge statement and rewrote the variables and everything seems to be fine now.
Please use the 'code block' option when pasting your code. It's hard to read as it stands. Start here: /*RENAMING VARIABLES FOR EASE OF USE*/ rename AGECD=AGE IDUCD= IDU HOUSECD= HOUSING PCPCD= PRIMARYCARE INSURCD= INSURANCE EDUCD= EDUCATION INCCD= INCOME PRIMLANG= LANGUAGE RAPIDCD= RAPID COINFCD= COINFECTION; /*MAKING AGE GROUPS*/ if AGECD ge 18 AND AGECD &lt; 30 then AGECAT=1; else if AGECD ge 30 AND AGECD &lt; 40 then AGECAT=2; else if AGECD ge 40 AND AGECD &lt; 50 then AGECAT=3; else if AGECD ge 50 AND AGECD &lt; 60 then AGECAT=4; else if AGECD ge 60 then AGECAT=5; if AGECD le 50 then AGEDI=1; else AGEDI=2; You're renaming variables, then try to make new variables based on the old variable-names. I can't tell for certain how SAS processes this, but it *might* be the issue. Start and see whether it helps deleting the rename statement. &amp;#x200B;
Hey OP - just a heads up, I think you accidentally doxxed yourself. You probably want to edit your post to get rid of your first/last name in the libname statement. 
You're labeling instype, but you aren't inputting it.
On that note, if you're from the frigid north, Dallas will probably be warmer. I went when it was in Long Beach. Yet another reason to use up some company travel budget.

Haven’t done this in a while usually end up using the pcfiles dbms to get it working. 
One thing that helps with this approach is to create a blank template workbook with all the named ranges set up, then tell SAS to copy the template and populate the copy with your new data each time you run the report.
SAS Visual Studio is almost exactly the same, if it's available.
I think you need to elaborate more on your variables and outcome. Is your outcome dichotomous (i.e., willing to pay yes or no) or is it ordinal as in they rate their willingness to pay ranked 1-5, or is the outcome measured some other way? It also sounds like you have several variables being health, time, and health*time not one categorical variable? 
Not for free. If you’re coding there’s no real difference though. 
Willingness to pay is measure by the amount that was bid on the cook stoves. There were four groups that bid on the stoves. One received no marketing message (control), one was told about the health benefits of the stoves, one was told that the stoves save time and money, and the last group got both messages. My current model is this: bid = a + group + age + gender + income + owns\_car+.... I'm looking for a way where the groups that received a marketing message are compared against the control group.
It sounds like you are doing multiple linear regression. Do you know what procedure you are using? You could make one group be the control and have 4 total groups. Since it is a categorical variable dummy variables will be created in sas or you will have to code them your self depending on what procedure you are doing. You could make the control group be your baseline and not create a dummy variable for it, which would allow you to compare the other models to the baseline model. Since its a categorical variable you would technically get a different model for each group with only the intercept really changing. I'm not sure if this is what youre looking for or how much knowledge you have of statistics. I'm a masters student in biostatistics and am a statistical consultant, but am still wrong all the time so dont take my word this is correct.
This is a decent approach - shorter version, change your group variable to have two groups, control and non control. You can also test specific hypothesis about your models using PLM proc. 
The easiest way would be to do an ANOVA and compare the mean bid amount of each group with the control group using an post-hoc dunnet t-test with your control group, but it looks like you have a regression model with adjustments. Here's a link that talks about how to create dummy variables which you'll need to do for your categorical variable and then how to run the proc regress. If you decide not to do with adjustments and do an ANOVA, proc glm with a class statement before your model will automatically create dummy variables for you. &amp;#x200B; [https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/sas/webbooks/reg/chapter3/regression-with-saschapter-3-regression-with-categorical-predictors/](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/sas/webbooks/reg/chapter3/regression-with-saschapter-3-regression-with-categorical-predictors/) &amp;#x200B;
Use the MOD function \[hint: MOD(XXX,12)\] on the number of months you get back from INTICK.
so i think this is going to be way more complex than i originally thought...which is usually how these things go. Not only do i need to group by M1, M2, etc. but i also need to calculate all of my totals based on activity performed before the end of that month. So for sale that hit in Jan'16. If im looking at M3 i need to total all activity up through Mar'16 and not after. 
It is unclear what your intent is, but a space is the same as an other character. You specify it by enclosing it in quotation marks: data _null_; length s $3; s = "1" || " " || "3"; put s; run; If you want to be a little more clear you might consider having a variable equal to the ASCII space character: data _null_; length s $3; space = '20'x; s = "1" || space || "3"; put s; run;
Is there a function that can do this?
If you don't like ||, then use one of the CAT functions. CATS(word1, " ", word2) should give roughly equivalent behaviour to word1 || " " || word2.
Nah this is fairly easy once you get used to it. Trick is to get your dates into two numerical fields: one for the year and one for the month, but treat Jan as 0 and Dec as 11, then your can group and sum pretty easily. 
Catx(“ “,word1,word2,...word-n)
In most instances I prefer an underscore to a blank.
This is proc means with the right format applied. You haven’t shown any data p, code or expected results, so we have no idea where you’re having issues. If you can’t share your real data, use the shoes or prdsale dataset in Sashelp library or make fake data. 
I'd sort the activity by year and month (two separate variables) and then do data step processing with first.mo and last.mo. That should make it pretty easy to accumulate activity and report on the M1, M2, M3, etc.
Yes, exactly. I'd sort on yr and mo and then accumulate each month's activity with first.mo and last.mo in a data step.
Might also want to TRIM word1 and word2, just to be safe.
Check out COMPBL function. 
It's not the data that's the issue, my company has very strict rules (due to confidential information) so basically every useful site is blocked. Aside from using my phone (which we actually aren't supposed to have out...as rediculous as is is) I can't access Reddit, any forums, any sas communities, or even YouTube to watch how-to's (mostly for power bi and tableau help) 
Check torrents for SAS9.3. the license SID file is also found by googling for it
Yes, hence roughly. I think I meant to say that CAT(word1, " ", word2) should be roughly equivalent to the || version, while CATS(word1, " ", word2) should be close to TRIM(word1) || " " || TRIM(word2). And then there's all the other CATs out there too ...
I managed secure labs with no internet connection on the machines. The SAS help is quite helpful once you learn how to navigate it. It’s built in it the product. Find and bookmark the following: * Formats by category * Functions by category * Base procedures * Base Stat Procedures 90% of what you need will be in those sections. 
Why? That’s what proc means, summary, tabulate or report are for. Or even proc sql. Doing it in a data step is inefficient. 
It depends. If it's being processed in a data step anyway to create the month/year and M1, M2, M3, it might be just as easy to process the totals on that same pass through the data.
Got it. I don't think I've used CATS before, and probably not CAT, either. I usually just use the pipes. Thank you for the clarification.
Get on a business intelligence team that uses SAS as one of their primary tools Source: I only had college SAS experience and was hired onto a business intelligence team that uses SAS as a primary tool
Financial Services and Consulting. See what the banks and Big 4 firms have open.
What kind of consulting jobs use SAS and how? Any examples? I am currently working internally at a bank with SAS, but I am not sure how consultants would come into play.
Banks often hire SAS contractors for specific projects. Many people move from one project to the next as a contractor, usually earning more as a contractor than similar full-time employees would. Others prefer the stability of converting to full time if the opportunity arises.
I've been with SAS for a year and in the past year I've been more exposed to their products and the many projects/companies SAS works with. I've been programming in SAS and using mainly 9.4/EG since 99. Many companies like getting the code written and maintaining it and that's it. That's been my primary experience. Healthcare/Banking/Medical supplies were the main industries I worked with. I would try to find a company that invests heavily in analytics. The government as well, and always keep an eye on a career with SAS if you like the language/applications.
You can do finance stuff, but a lot of those are getting converted or filled with people who are looking to retire in place. Or they'll be a relatively short-term contract offer. CROs are definitely probably the biggest SAS market. In terms of career, your best advancement opportunity might be expanding on the CRO and SAS angle. You should be able to transition SAS work into some pretty good regulatory affairs positions.
when you say inefficient, do you mean performance wise? 
This is the approach I wouldn’t mind doing, but I would need to get my masters. Masters in stats is something I don’t think I can go through, would an MBA be helpful or what other degree would be good? I know my local university has a masters in bioinformatics, that might be good just very specific. 
I'd look for a job that requires SAS, but has other professionals who use Python or R and expresses a desire to expand the use of those other tools. You can excel in the job via your SAS skills, but may have opportunities to learn other tools which would expand your resume and open doors for you. I'm in banking/credit risk analytics and we still productionalize models in SAS, but there are opportunities to use Python or R for ad-hoc work, development work, visualizations, etc. Your lack of experience would be tough to navigate, but we just hired someone from healthcare from our team because he had good quantitative skills and knew SAS.
Also pretty new to SAS, but I’ve found Kaggle.com to be a great tool when learning how to use a new language or software. Some of the lower difficulty projects will even have step by step guides on github for your language or software.
Look for groups doing market risk calcs (VAR, cfar, mtm) , ifrs regulatory stuff. 
SAS offers [SAS Programming I](http://support.sas.com/training/us/paths/prg.html) for free as a web course. That should get you used to the coding interface and basics. You already know SQL, so SAS SQL should be a natural path you can take. A pro tip is that most of SAS EG (point and click) calculates stats using SQL and you can view the code to see what SAS did behind the scenes. EG is basically a GUI that writes SAS code. I've taken every course for Base and Advanced Certification, but don't really see certification as necessary in my field. We use SAS as a tool, but it's not our actual job. In my field most people just know SPSS so just having advanced SAS training is enough. I'd feel out what the standards are in your field.
Hmm , I'll check out.
Since I'm starting with SAS , is it really in demand? Or should i concentrate on R? I'm confused a bit. 
It's organization and field specific. In our org we're talking about making a transition to R because it's open-source and SAS is expensive. R is gaining a lot of traction in social sciences because it's powerful and free, but SAS is an existing standard.
I would recommend certification only if your company/school/etc. paid for it. There's value in learning the material for the certification, but I sort of view these credentials as being more about promotions inside of an organization or defining your experience if you're coming from a background that doesn't necessarily suggest programming competence (Say, a History major who wants to go do analytic data work).
That's a good point. I'm a cs major &amp; been codin for 6 years now. So I'll skip certification just focus on material then. 
Focus on R and leave it at that. No need for SAS when having the skills you're mentioning 
Can't you use R within SAS? So the answer is likely to go R regardless?
What you want to do is to calculate a Kaplan Meier curve using proc lifetest
I believe you can use R and SAS within one another to some degree. Again it really comes down to organization and field preferences. Where I work (federal government) SAS is fully approved for use. R itself is also approved but several packages to make R useful aren't. And it's hard to approve open source packages for use on a DoD network. My current approach is to use SAS because I'm proficient in it, and learn R when work allows.
I do have KM curve made in Graphpad. Isn't that good to calculate OS?
Yes, absolutely worthwhile if you're looking for a career in data and analytics but long term you need to know multiple languages and be able to apply principals that aren't language specific. &amp;#x200B; In general SAS is the best enterprise analytics platform around and will run any R or python code you write anyway. Language is less important than concepts overall though.
I use SAS all day every day at my job. I work for a mid sized financial institution. DM me if you have any questions.
See the r swat package: https://github.com/sassoftware/R-swat Disclaimer: may not work with the free version of sas.
I've gotten a lot of mileage out of my certainly over the years, but nothing that would've been worth dropping...what, $3600 or so for SAS 1-3 and the exams themselves if someone else weren't paying. Plus these days there are WAY more online ways to learn. I will say though that IF somebody else is paying the SAS Institute classes are top notch, and the certs do look good to people, despite being very poor measures of how good a SAS programmer you are.
Should volume only measure the primary surgeon? For example, should Volume = 0 if the primary surgeon has not performed a surgery in the past 365 days, but the secondary surgeon has?
Correct, I'm currently only trying to capture the primary surgeon's volume for each case. However, if the primary surgeon was secondary or tertiary on another case within 365 days I'm trying to count that towards his volume for that case. Hopefully that makes sense. 
You can configure .sas files to open in EG and Base using SAS Deployment Manager, but I will look into if you set an option to make a new instance. 
Correction The format is DATETIME25.6 Even less info available.
Couple of things. First, I'm a fan of writing code that you're positive gives you the right answer first, and then making it fancy after. So with that in mind, here's what I'd do. I'd sort the data by the primary doc column and then by dates of surgery. Use the power of the LAG statement. Something like: &amp;#x200B; data \_want\_(keep=doc1 volume); set \_have\_; by doc1 proc\_dt; if first.doc1 then do; volume = 0; prev\_surg = .; end; prev\_surg = lag(proc\_dt); if proc\_dt - prev\_surg &lt;= 365 then volume + 1; if last.doc1 then output; run; &amp;#x200B; Something like this should work. It might need a bit of tweaking with the syntax, but I think that's pretty close. I'm assuming you just want a data set that has just the primary doc and volume counts. Then you could replace the doc1 (primary doc) field with the secondary and tertiary doc columns and re-use most of the same code. But this basic approach should get you there. I am guessing there are fancier ways to do this, but honestly, unless you have a good reason to worry about efficient processing, I think it's far better to stick with solid approaches that are simple and easily testable. 
In SAS, dates and times are stored as a numeric variable. Specifically, datetimes are stored as the number of seconds since midnight 01/01/1960. In order to specify a specific datetime in code you use a [datetime constant](http://support.sas.com/kb/24/604.html). For example: data filter; where datetime &gt;= '01mar2019:00:00:00'dt; run; You could also use the [DHMS function](https://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=lefunctionsref&amp;docsetTarget=p1b9d1kbo0czoxn1ouj1kcxwqzn1.htm&amp;docsetVersion=9.4&amp;locale=en) to create a datetime value. The [DATETIMEw.d](https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/leforinforref/64790/HTML/default/viewer.htm#n0av4h8lmnktm4n1i33et4wyz5yy.htm) format just displays the numeric value as a datetime with a width of w and the number of decimal places d. [This paper](https://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings15/1334-2015.pdf) is a good general introduction to dates and times in SAS. For any additional help you'd probably have to show us your code and or log. Good luck!
Thanks, I've never used the LAG statement so was unaware. I'll try playing with this, unfortunately I'm after a more granular detail and not just the primary doc and volume. I need the primary doctors volume count at the time that they operated on a patient, not just the total overall volume for that surgeon. 
Help us to help you. Spend a little time reading "formatting help" on Reddit and learn how to format source code (and data) so that we can read it. First consider a more complete version of your test data: data temp1; id = 1; do year = 2000 to 2004; do month = 1 to 12; if ((mod(year, 2) = 0) and (mod(month, 2) = 0)) then var1 = 999; else var1 = .; output; end; end; run; The goal here was to generate a sample where half the years have data in var1 but the other have does not. id year month var1 dummy 1 2000 1 . 1 1 2000 2 999 1 ... 1 2001 1 . . 1 2001 2 . . 1 2001 3 . . The next step is to think about, *What indicates the records that I want to flag as having data?* There are many ways to do this, but PROC SQL combines a few steps: proc sql noprint; create table yeardata as select distinct id, year, 1 as dummy from temp1 where (var1 ne .) order by id, year; quit; This creates a dataset that only has records for id/year combinations that have some data in var1: id year dummy 1 2000 1 1 2002 1 1 2004 1 Now we just need to merge this back with the original: data temp2; merge temp1 yeardata; by id year; if (dummy = .) then dummy = 0; run; Which gives us the result: id year month var1 dummy 1 2000 1 . 1 1 2000 2 999 1 1 2000 3 . 1 ... 1 2001 1 . 0 1 2001 2 . 0 1 2001 3 . 0 
I think I've gotten close with the following code: &amp;#x200B; proc sql; create table myTable as select participant_id, dos, surgeon1_id from have union select participant_id, dos, surgeon_id_v2 from have where not (surgeon_id_v2 is missing) union select participant_id, dos, surgeon_id_v3 from have where not (surgeon_id_v3 is missing) ; quit; data want; set mytable; by surgeon1_id dos; if first.surgeon1_id then do; volume = 0; end; prev_surg = .; prev_surg = lag(dos); if dos - prev_surg &lt;= 365 then volume + 1; else volume = 0; run; &amp;#x200B; It's close but I'm not entirely sure why it's tabulating totals where date is missing. Also the first observation for surgeon 00-011 should be 0. Any suggestions? &amp;#x200B; Thank you! 
Sorry about the formatting. I had typed it on mobile. Should be fixed now. But thanks! The PROC SQL statement worked like a charm! I had been trying various things similar to that but hadn’t got the logic just right! Thanks again!
Great advice! I find the DATEPART function (mentioned in the paper) to be very useful when dealing with datetime variables.
Use datepart (date) 
Date=datepart(datetime value). Then you can filter the date column however you want. If you want dates after 01mar2019 it’s : Date &gt; “01mar2019”d
No worries. Happy to help. 
If I’m understanding correctly I this should work. I’m on my phone so I can’t test it. Data new table; Set old table; Retain dummy; By year; If first.year then dummy=0; If var is missing then dummy =1; Run; What’s happening is since your data is sorted by year you can use the by statement to create first and last indicators for year. Retain keeps the value of dummy. Every new year , or first.year =1 you want to set dummy back to 0.

I know you've solved it already, but in this case another easy way would be use proc transpose to get one row per year with 12 variables for the months. Then if any of the 12 variables is non-missing, you know the year had data.
https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63347/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_freq_sect028.htm Does your code look like the code on this page? You need to have the binomial option in your tables statement.
I'm running a two-way proc freq, and when I have had a binomial option, I have only had it measure 1 level, or the lower level option (such as 0) when I am looking for 1. The value I am looking for is the percent of current female smokers (cfemalesmoker=1) and frequent snuff users (fsnuff=1), and I want a 95% CI.
Do you have a connection to the SAS for Academics server on your personal machine? Coursera.com offers a SAS course, with a free 7-day trial; it’ll walk you through how to establish a link to the SAS for Academics server. You can then stick with the class or terminate and keep the connection to the SAS server. That’ll give you access to all the sashelp datasets and you can actually use SAS to practice and get more comfortable before taking the test. 
Hey man, tough to hear about your struggles. Have you tried problem-orientated learning? You know what problem you want to solve, and learn as you go? I find that its the superior way for me to Learn both SAS and R
Hey! Thanks for your response. So I’m already attending classes and I have a virtual work station set up on my laptop which has the data sets for practice and SAS 9.1 the issue i face with is concepts. Specially the second half of the portions which covers double trailing (@@) when to use else if, else do. Creating a detail record for a single observation. I’ll try and put up pictures of my code here and seek help. But thank you so much for your advice. I really appreciate it. 
No problem at all. Best of luck!
Hey, you may want to take this free course available online from SAS - https://support.sas.com/edu/schedules.html?id=13978. 
This form is typically for questions and discussions of SAS the statistical software package. you may get more answers if you post in r/PCMasterRace than here
I think you got the wrong SAS ;).
Look at order = option on the proc freq statement or just recode your data to be 1 and 2 so that 2 is the one you don’t the percentage for. 
i checked them they are a gaming forum not a hard drive forum i am looking for a forum about sas drives
You do not want to learn on SAS 9.1 - that’s likely as old as you are-download SAS UE or use SAS On Demand for Academics which are both free. You’ll learn inefficient and older methods if you learn off 9.1 and if anyone gives you a coding test you’ll fail it. Or at least will show that you have a lot to learn which isn’t what they want to see. SAS lays out the syllabus pretty clearly. Take the free courses and go to communities.sas.com and try and answer questions people have posted. Questions people are asking are likely to be close to what you need to learn anyways. And there’s the solution there to work through. The Little SAS book is also a great resource. 
In the fifth edition of "SAS Certification Prep Guide: Base Programming for SAS 9", there's a pretty good discussion about Excel engines in Chapter 4. Maybe that's serviceable for the purposes of the base programmer exam?
The test is changing this year. Are you planning to do the new or old test? If the old test, the certification guide is great. What test questions are you having issues with? Not all resources online are the same quality. I think there’s a SASsensei website thats pretty decent with the quality of their questions. 
Oh interesting, thanks, I didn't know that the test was changing. Do you know when the test will change? Naively, I suppose the old test since I already have the guide that helps for it. In terms of online resources, I tried the link below and got several wrong, e.g. #2, 3, 9. Thanks, I'll check out sassensei! [https://www.listendata.com/2014/05/sas-base-certification-questions-with.html](https://www.listendata.com/2014/05/sas-base-certification-questions-with.html)
It changes in July, currently you can do either. I would recommend investigating both. The new test involves programming, the old is multiple choice. And they’ve removed most sections on reading data. 
Ok, that's all really good to know. I can't find any further information using Google, can you possibly link me to any sources to read more?
I took the beta for the new exam back in December. If you have any questions on it let me know. There is a prep guide and practice exam for it now too. The advanced exam will follow suit later this year as well. https://www.sas.com/en_us/certification/credentials/foundation-tools/base-programming-specialist.html
Try coloumn input. (Based on my understanding)
Can it be used with dsd ? I tried, it didn't work.
Tried, didn't work. Any other suggestion?
If the number of blanks is same in each observation then you can add them in dataset.
Not same, as of now I am reading whole row as string and using substr. 
Substr returns a single value(right?), it might take a lot of time and process.
Right. Since I had 2 columns, so I am using substr meanwhile.
Use FORMAT Statement Format variable1 $char20. I use 20 as an example.
$char format worked, though I used it in input statement. Thanks!!
Great!
Would you mind explaining what you're talking about in terms of old and inefficient methods learned in 9.1? There are fundamentals in SAS that are universal to any version. You can learn the fundamentals of the program data vector and data step processing in any edition of SAS, for example. &amp;#x200B;
Thanks, I definitely will!
We all have our own test taking strengths and weaknesses, but generally speaking is one version or the other (new vs old) regarded as being as easier or harder? 
Yeah, but some of the features such as the STACKODS option in proc means doesn’t exist so you end up doing a lot more work for the same output. Variable and datasets shortcut lists are some others. ODS isn’t as well developed either. All of these can be achieved in other ways, but they’ll either make you look like a really old programmer who hasn’t kept up. Especially since the newer versions are FREE to use for learning. 
They only way I know how is determining all the combinations and then writing a SQL Case When statement — but that’s a ton of code and not efficient. So, hopefully there’s another way. 
This is admittedly my weak spot in SAS, but the answer would be using arrays, I believe. Spit-balling here, but I think you'll need to sort each row across v1-v5, and then count distinct values. Once you've got a 3 in a row, set equal to "yes" and then calculate. &amp;#x200B; I think if you tried something like below, you could two new fields for each observation. First would be count of unique values in the row; second would be counts of the same values in the row. &amp;#x200B; data want; set have; array col {5}; call sortn (of col1-col5); unique\_val = (col1 &gt; .); do \_n\_=2 to 5; if col{\_n\_} &gt; col{\_n\_-1} then unique\_val + 1; if col{\_n\_} = col{\_n\_ -1} then same\_val+1; end; keep id unique\_val same\_val; run; &amp;#x200B; You'll have to tweak that - I'm guessing there's a syntax in there somewhere - but hopefully you or someone else here knows a bit more about arrays to finish this out. At the very least, you should be able to fill out the "equal" column you had in your example able based on whether unique\_val&gt;3 or if same\_val&gt;=3. 
Transpose, proc freq and join is one option. An array and counting is the other. Is the requirement 3 because that’s the majority percentage?
No problem. If you go the new exam route. The content guide follows the exam. The beta exam was almost 3 hrs and 55 to 60 questions lol. Production exam is like 2 hrs and 45ish questions. Probably around 60/40 Programming vs old style questions, but I'm not sure if they kept that ratio for the production exam. They do have an "upgrade" exam for those with the old exam. Like 1 hr and 20 something questions. Definitely was rough coming up with things from scratch. I just coded out things with the content guide as practice. 
Long story short I'm doing a monte-carlo simulation of a dice game. 3 is just part of the rules of the game. That array solution should work best. 
You can look across the arrays as rutgerswhat mentioned, and this was my first approach when I looked at this but it gets a bit messy. Datascigeek got me thinking about transposes and this is the solution that I came up with. It doesn't matter how wide your dataset is, though in the case of it being 6 or more wide with two different sets of three it would take the lowest first: I wanted to do it in one step so if anyone has an answer for that I'm interested! &amp;#x200B; `data indata;` `infile datalines delimiter=',';` `input v1-v5;` `datalines;` `10,3,6,4,4` `2,4,2,2,1,` `5,5,5,5,3,` `1,3,5,10,6` `;` `run;` `/* Add a row counter */` `Data Add_obs;` `set indata;` `Obs = _n_;` `run;` `/* Transpose to get a single long collumn */` `Proc transpose data=Add_obs out=Add_obs_trans;` `by Obs;` `run;` `/* Sort to take advantage of by processing */` `Proc sort data=Add_obs_trans out=Add_obs_trans_sort;` `by obs col1;` `run;` `/* check to see if there are any records that are greater than three */` `Data Add_obs_trans_sort_2(keep=obs col1);` `set Add_obs_trans_sort;` `by obs col1;` `if first.col1 then count = 0;` `count +1;` `if count ge 3 then output;` `run;` `/* this removes the double record in observation 3 */` `proc sort data= Add_obs_trans_sort_2 out=Add_obs_trans_sort_nodup nodupkey;` `by obs col1;` `run;` `/* Now we want to join on to the dataset were we had a row counter*/` `/* And conditonally multiply by 10 */` `Data Multiply_results (drop= COL1 i) ;` `merge Add_obs (in=a)` `Add_obs_trans_sort_nodup (in=b);` `by obs;` `if a;` `/* Define array to look over the variables */` `array values(*) v1-v5;` `if COL1 ne . then` `do;` `do i = 1 to dim(values);` `if values(i) = COL1 then values(i) = COL1*10;` `end;` `end;` `run;` `/* Huzzauh! */` 
You also need to check if v2 = v4, otherwise this doesn't work if you have 3 central values, e.g. 1,2,2,2,3. To generalise for a search for k identical values in an array of size n, you can loop through the array from index 1 to n - k + 1 checking if v(i) = v(i + k - 1).
Meh, at the end of the day I think you are trying too hard to be "right" about something that I don't really think is a big deal at all. The examples you gave of "old and inefficient" methods are what I personally would describe as more "bells and whistles" types of things. You don't really need them in order to be a good SAS programmer. What you do need are a good grasp of fundamentals, which as I said before can be learned in any version of SAS. 
Try creating another array, and for each variable, checking if it's equal to any previous value. Then, you can count the "instances" of v1, v2, v3, etc. `data work.test;` `set work.orig;` `/*Your original variables*/` `array a {5} v1-v5;` `/*Array to count the number of times each value appears*/` `array test {5} t1-t5;` `do i = 1 to 5;` `test{i} = 0;` `end;` &amp;#x200B; `test{1} = 1;` `do i = 2 to 5;` `do j = 1 to i-1;` `if a{i} eq a{j} then do;` `flag = 1;` `test{j} = test{j} + 1;` `leave;` `end;` `end;` `if flag eq 0 then do;` `test{i} = 1;` `end;` `end;` `run;`
Let me put it this way then, I give all my programmers/data scientists a test before they’re hired. I’m hiring the person who can use those features over someone who doesn’t. It’s a matter of efficiency and time. And 9.1 cannot deal with ZIP, XML, or JSON files. I don’t disagree that you can learn the fundamentals it just is silly when you can easily get free access to the full version. I’m fine with disagreeing here anyways it’s the OPs choice and they need to weigh that for themselves. And I’ll still make this recommendation. 9.1 was released in 2003, 9.1.3 in 2004. Reddit was started in 2005. Twitter in 2006. 
Thanks, that’s a quick addition anyways! 
Again - the examples you keep citing are corner cases at best. Unless you happen to be the only SAS programmer I've ever heard of who works even once in a while with those file types (note: in my 15 years of experience, I never have), working with those file types doesn't matter. 
ok. 
I use them mostly to make loops and dynamic text.
I use macros for dynamic code like atomofconsumption. If you run the same code routinely, that is dependent of time or other varying variables, you can effectively "select your outcome" using macros if this makes sense. 
True OOP doesn’t exist in SAS to my knowledge with the absence of classes for example. Macros and macro variables do allow you to modularize your code, so in some sense it gives more of a OOP feel than just data steps and procs. 
Normal vars are only available within the scope of a single data step, aren't they? Macro variables are available and have scope across the entire program. You can, for example, declare and assign a macro var at the start of a program and use it for multiple data steps, e.g. for a common criteria value.
The #1 thing I use macros for is setting selection criteria at the very start of my code that will apply to multiple datasets and that may change later- for example, start and end dates. It’s much easier to set the time period with macro variables at the beginning if I might want to look at a different period later and use “if ‘&amp;startdate’d&lt;=date&lt;=‘&amp;enddate’d;” throughout my code, than to have to make sure I find and change every single date in my code when I decide to change the time period. They’re also helpful for when I want to output some value from one dataset and then use that value for something else in another dataset or proc of some sort- sure, I could do it manually and then find and change every spot in my code where I used the value, but it’s much easier and less susceptible to errors if I have SAS do it for me (plus, I’ve made many of my routine reports automatic because I don’t need to make manual code changes). 
I hate to be harsh but the answer is some of us actually work on real problems and wish to be efficient. If you do not have a reason to use macro variables and/or can not understand why then you have either a very easy requirements for your SAS projects or your code is a walking disaster.
Yes, I'm a beginner in sas and i thought someone who is a senior would explain about macros by connecting the dots backwards.
Gotcha, then the simplest answer is you can use them as global variables that span data steps, prevent a forgotten replacement, and don't clog up your output. Typically, I use them as parameters or passthroughs.
Are you looking to vertically sum the binary variable or is there logic like if there is at least one '1', the resulting aggregation shows '1', otherwise '0'? Like what if you have 50 a1/b1/c1 combinations with a '1' in the first binary column? Will your sum yield '50' or will it yield '1'?
I want to vertically sum the binary variable as it seems to be the easiest method. there will never be more than 1 in a column for each unique id so it will always be 1 or 0
In SAS an array is purely a DATA step construct, they don't exist in PROC SQL. If you want to use arrays, you could, of course write a DATA step to do the task e.g.: data combined; set original; by A B C; array OPTCOV {5} _1-_5; array SUMS {5} sum1-sum5; do i = 1 to 5; if first.A then SUMS{i} = 0; SUMS{i} + OPTCOV{i}; end; if last.A then output; drop i _1-_5; run; PROC SUMMARY can also do what you want, and is arguably less cumbersome. While you can't use arrays there either, you can at least use name range lists, which aren't available in PROC SQL. proc summary data=original sum nway; var _1-_5; class A B C; output out=combined(drop=_type_ _freq_) sum=; run;
Probably numerous ways to do this. I'm more comfortable with proc sql for vertical sums where the groupbys are collapsed, so here is what I'd do. This requires you to name your numeric binary colums to have a consistent prefix (x1, x2, ..., x9999). &amp;#x200B; `/*creating prototype dataset*/` `data prototype1;` `input A $ B $ C $;` `datalines;` `a1 b1 c1` `a1 b1 c1` `a1 b1 c1` `a1 b1 c1` `a1 b1 c1` `a2 b2 c2` `a2 b2 c2` `a2 b2 c2` `a2 b2 c2` `;` `run;` &amp;#x200B; `data prototype2;` `set prototype1;` `array x {81} x1-x81;/*arbitrary number*/` `do i = 1 to dim(x);` `x{i} = rand("Bernoulli",.5);` `end;` `drop i;` `run;` &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; `/*summing methodology*/` `proc sql NOPRINT;` `SELECT count(*)` `into :countOfBinaryCols` `from dictionary.columns` `where upcase(libname) = "WORK"` `and upcase(memname)=upcase("prototype2") and type="num"` `order by name` `;` `quit;` `%put |||&amp;countOfBinaryCols.|||;` &amp;#x200B; `%macro container ();` &amp;#x200B; `proc sql;` `create table final_table as` `select distinct a,b,c` `%do i = 1 %to &amp;countOfBinaryCols.;` `,sum(x&amp;i.) as x&amp;i.` `%end;` `from prototype2` `group by a,b,c` `;` `quit;` &amp;#x200B; `%mend;` `%container ();`
Macro variables are useful in making your code dynamic. For example you have 10 tables you need to do same data step on, instead of writing that data step 10 times you can have it written once then set your value for each table. This is a simple example and you might still wonder why bother so a better example would be setting data paths. You set a macro variable %let path = /whatever/directory/you/need/ Now everytime you need to refer to that directory you only write &amp;path. Instead of the path AND bonus when you need to change the directory reference you can do that by just changing your %let statement instead of going through the code finding everywhere you wrote /whatever/directory/you/need and manually changing it everywhere. It keeps the code cleaner more user friendly and concise. Also when you learn to be clever with macros it makes your life much easier and you end up with reusable tools For example I wrote a macro function that takes tables from a library and inserts their data as a sheet into same excel spreadsheet. The code itself is less than 20 lines and could even be shortened furthermore but the loops do the hard work for me. Long story short: work smart not hard. Learn to use macros! 
I hate to be harsh but your answer is neither a constructive criticism nor a helpful explanation of what a macro is. When you dont have anything nice or constructive to say its best to not say it. It discourages others and makes you look not only unprofessional but outright a jerk. 
This is exactly correct. Not only that, macro variables scope extends to %include programs. There are so many reasons to use macro variables but their scope is definitely a main one.
You can put regex queries into macro variables. You can use it to process a data step line by line of a source data set. You can use a combination of a 'shell' program with macro variables for your project and use %INCLUDE on base programs made to work with whatever project (after importing and streamlining your data). You can use them to build strings conditionally for dataset variables. You can do a whole lot with them that you can't do with dataset variables. The scope is probably the main reason most people use them.
The SAS Macro language is a means of writing dynamic code, i.e. code that you can adjust based on parameters and conditions. Macro variables are part of those parameters. For example, if you want to run a bunch of analysis on the variables "sex age cob" such that you keep writing those three variables in that order (e.g. it's your var statement in the PROC SORT, then it's the class statement in your PROC MEANS, etc), and then you want to run the same analysis but on the variables "sex age marstat", and then on "age cob marstat", then what you can do is: &amp;#x200B; 1. Write the code for one iteration. 2. Put "%let varlist = sex age cob;" at the top of your code. 3. Replace all instances of "sex age cob" with "&amp;varlist". 4. Run your code (and make sure it does what it's meant to do). 5. Change the first line to "%let varlist = sex age marstat" and run the code again. 6. Repeat 5, but for each other combination of variables. &amp;#x200B; If you want to get particularly fancy, you can even write a macro function that looks like this: %macro do_my_analysis(varlist=); ... code goes here ... %mend; So that whenever you type "%do\_my\_analysis(varlist=sex age cob)" it immediately creates all the code with the appropriate substitutions. Essentially - if you keep writing nearly-identical code, you can use macros to generate it more efficiently than just doing lots of cut-and-paste-and-search-and-replace.
The macro language allows you to try convince yourself that you're programming in a language that allows you to store variables in memory instead of in a dataset.
You can a script that can read all the logs and output a file that will notify you if you have any errors,warnings, unins, etc what you would like. This is helpful when you need to see all the programs and see if there’s any issue. 
There's no stand alone program that does this I take it?
Use %put statements to print helpful identifiers to your log, and vim or whatever other decent text editor to search for those
It’s more of a two part process. I am guessing you have a batch program that will run all your programs that is needed? Then you will need a separate program essentially directing the SAS program to check your directory (after batch submission) with your logs. I think this is the program you would be needing for checking all the logs instead of one log at a time.
For batch processes I don’t depend on the log file. There are checks built into the program that will write to a table if process is successful or failed. 
You can search Lexjansen.com for example log parser programs. 
Use the below at the start of a job proc printto log="/path/to/logfile.log" ; run ; And this at the end proc printto ; run ; Then call a macro which reads said log file, parsing out any errors/warnings/notes as you deem necessary. Example macro definitions : %MACRO LOGSTART(JOB) ; %GLOBAL JOBNAME LOGNAME ; %LET JOBNAME = &amp;JOB ; %LET LOGNAME = &amp;JOBNAME.\_%SYSFUNC(datetime(),date9.).log ; proc printto log="/path/to/logs/&amp;LOGNAME" ; run ; %PUT LOG START : &amp;JOBNAME ; %MEND ; &amp;#x200B; %MACRO LOGEND ; %PUT LOG END : &amp;JOBNAME ; proc printto ; run ; %PARSELOG ; %MEND ; &amp;#x200B; %MACRO PARSELOG ; data logread (keep=jobname logname errcnt warncnt) errwarn (keep=jobname logname log) ; infile "/path/to/logs/&amp;LOGNAME" truncover end=eof ; retain jobname "&amp;JOBNAME" logname "&amp;LOGNAME" ; input @1 log $char256. ; retain errcnt warncnt . ; if index(log,'WARNING:') then do ; warncnt + 1 ; output errwarn ; end ; if index(log,'ERROR:') then do ; errcnt + 1 ; output errwarn ; end ; if eof then output logread ; run ; /\* now do with the above two datasets as you see fit \*/ %MEND ; &amp;#x200B; Then for your program, simply : %LOGSTART(MyBatchJob) ; /\* program goes here \*/ %LOGEND ; &amp;#x200B; Simple,
Par for the course. The vast majority of recruiters know fuck all about the jobs they are recruiting for.
Do you have Office Analytics licenced and installed?
I am currently working with IT to get that installed, we do have it I personally do not have access to it yet
I now have it installed
If they were knowledgeable about SAS programming, they probably wouldn’t be working as a recruiter.. 
Install SAS Microsft Office Add-In and be done with it
Recruiters are not tech people they are sales. They are selling you...you got to help them with the selling points.
Yes, this is more or less standard in biotech/pharma especially at the lower level roles. At the sub-ad level the recruiters are usually junior people early in their careers. This changes as you get more senior and in turn get the attention of the more senior people assigned to the account and/or you establish a relationship with a boutique recruiting shop. The way to manage this is to use as many relevant keywords as you can when describing your experience to a recruiter. Another thing that is useful is to keep up your linked in and try to network with recruiters through there - you don't have an obligation to stay with one recruiter, the only thing not to do is applying to the same job through multiple recruiters - this is likely to get you blackballed and is arguably unethical anyways. 
They pretty much get paid by submitting applications to the company they were hired by. We're all just widgets to them.
Why not use a proper dash boarding tool? Power BI is free and can easily do this for you in a few minutes. 
I've never met a recruiter who had any knowledge about the jobs they're recruiting for. They're paper pushers and gate keepers. Smile and nod and prove to them that you deserve the hiring manager's time, then move on.
Ooh good point. We have a bunch of %include files that set up variables for use later on.
Yeah, overwhelmingly most your interactions with recruiters will not be worth the time you spend with them. For the last few years I have been getting hit up by recruiters at least twice a month, and I would say a good 50% of them are so new that they were working at a place like Applebee's less than a year earlier. (I always check LinkedIn profiles before even considering contact with a recruiter.) I have only met a few that are really good at identifying which candidates are a good fit for which jobs, and that is the kind of recruiter you need to to find. Probably the only way to find someone like this is to ask around. Often the people who could identify the best recruiters are people who have been on the hiring side...they would know who has sent them good candidates in the past.
Generally true, but I have met a few who are at PharmaSUG every year, and they tend to be better informed. I think they begin to pick up quite a bit being at the conference.
Also, I’m sorry, but I’m new to programming and coding overall. I can understand if this doesn’t seem challenging enough or I come across as super dumb. Thanks again!
Basically the idea is : Overall = (2 * Final + SUM (of Test:) - MIN (of Test:))/4 &amp;#x200B;
This worked! Could you please help me in understanding how exactly the Min function worked here? Thanks. 
There is also a rank function in SAS: http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrdict/64316/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a000212189.htm 
The SUM part just added ALL the Test scores \[Test1, Test2, Test 3\], the MIN part found the lowest score of \[Test1, Test2, and Test3\]. If you subtract the lowest from the sum of all of them, you get the sum of the top 2. HIGHEST+SECONDHIGHEST+LOWEST - LOWEST = HIGHEST + SECONDHIGHEST
Thank you so very much for your help. You dumbed this down for me. I appreciate your help. Thank you. 🙂
Thank you so much. I will check this out. I’ve been stressing out over my base SAS exam which I intent to take up soon. Appreciate you taking your time out and posting the link. Thank you 🙂
No problem! What’s the base SAS exam?
Most likely you’re using a function in your SQL query that doesn’t work with Netezza for some reason. Are you using ODBC? Do other, simpler queries work? If so, Reduce your code to the bare bones and see if it works. Start adding back complexity a step at a time until you can trace the error. Once you know what’s causing it, you can post back and we can likely help you resolve it. Otherwise, I know you can’t share your exact code, but can you mock up a very similar query using one of the data sets from SAS Help library? If not, you need to work with tech support because without the code or log it’s very hard to help you out. 
I figured it out!! I accidentally was referencing the wrong table in a join making cart product. Big issues. 
It’s a certification exam conducted by the SAS institute. They certify you if you clear it. And it’s an international certification. Exam is around 180 USD, 110 minutes. You’ll need to score a minimum of 70% to pass. Pattern of question asked are Multiple Choice Questions. 
Is it the same as SAS certification?
Yes. It’s divided into two parts though. Base and advanced. Both are different 
Ahhh gotcha. Thank you! Are you doing it for a particular career goal?
Yes. I finished grad school in 2015 and worked for banks in compliance. I would like to take up roles of business analyst where I get challenged on both the tech and functional aspects. Plus it never hurts to be a part of Analytics. I also want to move out of India. So I’m hoping I can make a more holistic resume eventually and move out. 
Nice! I guess I never really knew how SAS was used outside of public health
Oh it’s used everywhere. Compliance Analytics, Fraud Analytics, Anti-Money Laundering Analytics, (SAS AML) are just a few examples. There’s a food chain here that uses SAS.
How interesting! I had no idea!!
Go back and say $30/hr is my rate. 
Nobody can make this call for you. Is experience worth $5-$15/hr to you? I know I see rates in the $70 range all the time, so if you're trying to work up to those then maybe? Nobody can say what your situation is better than you.
I would say, "$30/hr is my rate and and I need that or more to justify a change." Start too low and you will always be behind...
Are you in the US? $30/hr for SAS? Contract rate is around $300/hr here. Pay for even junior SAS programmers is more like $50-60/hr. $[30](https://30.hr)/hr is criminal..and $25/hr is just a joke.
I am. The position would be in Maryland. 
Now it makes more sense they offered so low. It’s the pubic sector and if I’m correct, then it’s academia. I used to work in academia and most SAS programmers make less than 75K with masters degree. What’s your highest degree? That might take into account the low ball offer. Academia loves their degrees. Also do you have any SAS certs? It’s not much and doesn’t really mean anything, but some employers like to emphasize that. 
Academic pay of technical staff is generally a train wreck. The only reason to do it is if you're new to a field, don't have a lot of options, and want it on your resume. In general, most jobs like this are what I call "take it to leave it" jobs. Academia does a decent job of inflating staff titles and giving good benefits (if those are important to you), but to be paid a reasonable wage, you have to leave it.
I am in grad school now and studying for my SAS base/advanced certs. 
This is why I am inclined to take it. However, I am annoyed the offer is lower than what I am currently making working with data management and visualization. 
Really all you can do is negotiate title and benefits in that sort of scenario. Maybe ask if they can pay for conference travel or something.
This all depends on what else is on your resume, and therefore what this job is worth to you in terms of experience. I took some SAS programming gigs with sub-par compensation when I was right out of school, and it definitely helped me get a full-time SAS job with great compensation later on. It may be worth trying to negotiate using your current rate; given that you said this was an academic job in another post the rate they can pay may be effectively capped depending on how it is funded. If the job is directly funded by research grants they may have less flexibility. Hate to say it but ultimately it's a judgement call on your part how much you think getting this job may help you.
Where exactly is contract rate $300/hr?
Please tell us what market you are in that sees $300/hr SAS programming contracts. 
It's like offering an artist exposure instead of money. Dont sell yourself short. This is ridiculous. 
I expect to draw flak for this... but it’s not a career move unless you make more money.
You tell me where contract rate is 300/hr and I'll sell my house tonight.
Figure out what your pay could be in two years at each job. In 5 years? In 10 years? I started at that salary and now make 6 figures, but it’s a decade later. Obviously, YMMV, but which has the more promising future. 
I’ve seen those rates in TO but usually short term contracts with really high skill levels needed. AB usually has around $1-150 but we don’t have the big banks and insurers here. 
Remote contract for someone who is US based with 12+ years of experience is $60/hr on a W2. This is actually down 10% or so from 5 years ago .
use &gt; proc means; &gt; output out means.summary=suburb; &gt; class suburb; &gt; var variable1-variable7; &gt; run; &gt; proc means; &gt; output out means.summary=suburb; &gt; class shire; &gt; var variable1-variable7; &gt; run; and so on Then comnine data sets &gt; data combine; &gt; set suburb shire; &gt; run; probably even easier using PROC SQL
You could just set the datasets together. The only thing you would need to do is rename shire/housing/etc. into one variable name. Set all datasets and then just do a proc means for the average by variable. 
I decided to do this. Now, I will wait and see what happens. 
I don't disagree, but I think you could maybe take equal or less if you are pivoting in your career. Like I took slightly less to move from a client facing role to a technical role because I didn't want to write documents and pass technical specs to other developers for the rest of my career. I've since doubled my salary and have a much beefier resume. I think the rule should be to look at your 5 year salary progression and, if you think you'll greatly expand your earning potential by taking a short-term lateral move (or salary cut that fits in your budget) then you should consider it.
I used to hire contractors up to 75/hr usd, 300 is a nonsense figure.
They rejected my offer. Oh well. On to the next. 
Portland Oregon
Portland Oregon as well as pretty much any Federal contract for SAS programmers
Portland Oregon 
Finance industry or Federal contracts
I guess you just need to find the companies that understand that a great programmer is worth 100 times more than a good programmer. Not saying this is an entry level rate, but companies pay this for Enterprise Miner, SAS MOMA, SAS CIS, SAS VA, SAS GRID contractors. Too many people lowball themselves or don't go after the niche SAS skills that pay the big bucks without much more effort over jus SAS BASE 
Is that the price to the client or the actual hourly wage of the programmer? Usually federal contracts have overhead costs built into managing a contractor (e.g., HR, benefits, sickdays, PTO, etc). Which usually can scale up 2-5x depending on the company and work.
I think, at best, you're off by like 400%. 
Best of luck. Someone will hit your number. 
Got another email about sorry it didn't work out. Oh Well. 
SAS will automatically output once at the very end of the data step if there are no explicit outputs. Here, explicit outputs are being used so that SAS will output three times at different points in the code. Does the number of total observations increase? 
Yes, so without using the output explicitly, I got 5 observations. If I use the output, I get 15
Output statment writes the current observation in its current state to the result dataset. So if there is 3 outputs your final dataset has three times the observation count than the source data. With year=1, year=2 and year=3. The example trying to show you the different states of the same observation outputted multiple times Btw if you dont write any output, there is an implicit one at the and of every data set, but if you use even one that original will be overridden. 
Exactly- that’s because the default is to output once (at the end of the datastep) for each observation in the input dataset. With the explicit outputs, since there’s three of them, SAS outputs three different rows into the output dataset for each observation in the input dataset. 
Which book? 
So for example if the variable are A, B, C and D. I’ll get 3 outputs each for A, B, C and D?
Hi. This was a book given to me by professors at my training institute.
Oh ok ,does it have a name? 
I dont understand your example. Point is output writes the current state of the PDV to the result table. For example if you get rid off the first 2 outputs the the result data will have the same row count as the source, and year will be always 3 (because 3 is what the last state of year, that value will be in the PDV before the output)
No it doesn’t. Like I said, this was developed in house by the faculty of the institute. It contains exercises, solutions and the entire syllabus of base sas. It’s given out to the students who take admission. If you’re based out of Bangalore in India, you can contact Study Analytics for Base SAS coaching.
Gotcha! Had I not placed the explicit outputs for Year 1 and Year2 and placed it in the end right after Year 3, I’d have gotten the output which contains the totals just for year 3. 
You got it!
Aah yes! I understand now. Yeah, initially I had just one output statement and the year was always 3 and the observations were just 5. But now that I have explicitly mentioned the output statements for each year, SAS has been able to produce outputs for the years 1, 2 and 3. 
Thank you so much! I really appreciate you taking your time out and helping me with this. 🙂 
Oh ok np I'm from Chennai tho.
No problem!
I get that, and that would be the jacked up contract rate for a base programming, I am talking about what you would be paid as a SAS programmer working with EM, MOMA, CIS, CDISC, TSS, GRID, or RTDM. It is around $300/hr \[if you are getting paid less than that..well I personally think you are selling yourself short\]. I am not saying that someone with Base SAS only is going to get that rate, but if you go beyond that and get into the heavy data science/marking optimization stuff in the finance or pharma industry it pays pretty good. Not many jobs in that area.
Nevermind. I found this. [https://www.pharmasug.org/proceedings/2015/BB/PharmaSUG-2015-BB07.pdf](https://www.pharmasug.org/proceedings/2015/BB/PharmaSUG-2015-BB07.pdf)
 SAS Documentation is at: https://support.sas.com/en/documentation.html The Macro documentation can be found here: https://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=mcrolref&amp;docsetTarget=titlepage.htm&amp;docsetVersion=9.4&amp;locale=en
Art Carpenter's book on the macro language is really good.
Thanks for getting back to me so quickly!
Thanks for getting back to me so quickly :)
I've never used it for SAS files because I don't have a work specific github account and we have a separate version control (which sucks in comparison!) are we're forced to use that. If you're just new to github though, download git GUI or something. They're great for visualizing the branches and what not, makes literally all the git commands easy to learn and understand. I *assume* git can handle the SAS files. I know bitbucket can store and view them.
We just use sourcetree with SAS files....simple easy..and it works.
SAS has new built-in pushing and pulling from github repositories: https://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=lefunctionsref&amp;docsetTarget=n1mlc3f9w9zh9fn13qswiq6hrta0.htm&amp;docsetVersion=9.4&amp;locale=en Somewhat unrelated but could be a cool "flow", would be to work inside a jupyter notebook using the SAS kernel and you could run a pushing/pulling script whenever you needed to. Just my thoughts. SAS kernel for Jupiter notebook: https://github.com/sassoftware/sas_kernel
I think I’m in a pretty unique position as I do have access to GitHub at work. Traditionally, though, I don’t think that SAS programmers would use GitHub which is why I’m trying to figure out the best way to organize my files. Git can in fact handle SAS programs! 
Cool, I’ll check that out too. My company uses GitHub for other things, though, so I’m committed to learning it.
SAS is coming out with lots of great new features! I did see that documentation on git commands. Just trying to figure out how best to integrate them into my code. I’m guessing I’ll have to remember to commit changes when I’m done editing a program. That’s one the part I’m particularly worried about - remembering that step. I am not familiar with Jupiter notebooks but I’ve been hearing so much about them that it’s probably time for me to investigate. Thanks for the suggestion! 
really? SAS is a pretty big deal. very involved.......
I already did some analysis with my professor, one or two times. Then i tried to learn R bc its open-source, but it seems SAS easier than R, so i thought it would be better. But, no matter what, i have to learn one of the two at least to do some basic statistics. (Tukey, anova..)
Well in the real world R is free and SAS is significantly expensive. But you can do (and learn) a lot more with SAS as it has been an industry standard for a long time. If you can learn how to do the same analysis with R as you do with SAS, you will be a value add................
"The Little SAS Book" is a good one to pick up.
I'm pretty good with both R and SAS. R is the better option to learn if you plan to do any programming/analysis in the future. Plus it's free so it's easy to use without financial backing. SAS licenses are ridiculously expensive and the language itself is weird and not really like other languages. R is way more 'modern' if that makes sense.
I wholly disagree with this. I'm using R and SAS on a daily basis and R is significantly more flexible when compared. 
How is SAS "weird and not really like other languages"? And how is SAS not useful to do programming and analysis in the future? Thousands of companies use SAS, and there are lots of jobs in programming and analysis in those companies. Modern? What does that even mean? Sure, it's useful to learn R, but your arguments against learning SAS (other than cost) are just silly.
Jupyter notebook is a python-based tool. It allows you to switch between multiple different languages using "kernels" and display code directly on-screen. It's great for presentations, and showing off your code "flow" 
Nothing you learn in learning SAS is applicable to other mainstream languages. It's got it's own way for everything. Declaring functions in SAS is weird. Data steps are pretty weird. The PDV is pretty weird. Macro processing, pretty weird. It's all just really different than any other language I've used. In R's case, if OP learns it, they'll most likely walk away with some good ol' functional programming knowledge which is plenty applicable across the board. Plus the syntax and flow of coding in R is more like any mainstream language. I was just arguing OP would get more out of learning R. Even without factoring cost in I feel that's the case. Concepts you learn in R are broadly applicable. 
Art Carpenter anything is really good. 
If someone is going to work in an analytical role, SAS and/or SQL will pretty much do anything that is necessary. Those are the tools that I've used for 20 years. If someone wants to be an application programmer, not so much. But then again, most application programmers wouldn't end up here in a SAS forum. As for the weirdness, a data step is similar to an SQL join in a lot of ways. SAS functions are a lot like Excel functions. Declaring variables, while mostly optional in SAS, is pretty similar to other languages. SAS isn't really designed to be like other programming languages (despite originating from C). It allows less technical people to get a lot done without learning a complex language.
&gt;If someone is going to work in an analytical role That's kind of what my point is, OP's a student. A student who said: &gt;I have to bc to do the statiscal analysis from my academic project Which doesn't sound super excited and sounded perhaps like that may not be the career path they're planning to go down. My answer was directly targeted at OP being a student. I was in no way trying to say SAS is bad or anything close, just that it's unique. I think it would serve a student better to learn R. I in no way mean that as a jab at SAS.
That sounds awesome. So you can do this with SAS and not run into any kind of licensing issue? Do you have to have any particular version of SAS? 
There are some free e-learning courses available, and you can use SAS University Edition to practice the exercises in the trainings. There's a course called SAS Programming 1: Essentials that goes over a lot of the foundation skills you need, and there's also an intro to statistics course: [https://support.sas.com/edu/elearning.html?ctry=us&amp;productType=library](https://support.sas.com/edu/elearning.html?ctry=us&amp;productType=library) 
Udemy, YouTube are good sources for beginning. SAS is quite easy to pick up and get started with. Best of luck
SAS is free for learning as well. 
Enterprise is where SAS wins hands down. Package management in certain industries that are highly regulated is a nightmare. You’d need to hire a body to pretty much manage that alone. In fact, a DS team at a bank I know has done exactly that. They have hired two IT people to solely manage the R and Python installs, on top of standard DBAs required. 
&gt; but your arguments against learning SAS (other than cost) are just silly. No they're not. SAS is unlike any modern programming language. Anyone with actual programming experience would be shocked with how base SAS is just 2d tables that are not implemented as matrices with vectorized calculations. And no objects. The syntax is garbage and writing any function that isn't already a proc is an absolute nightmare. Put another way- if you know how to program, you can pick up R and Python very quickly. The same is unlikely true for SAS because previous programming experience would have taught you how to think and solve problems in ways that SAS prevents you from using.
And yet many of us figure out how to perform very complex data manipulations with SAS. If you really find it such "garbage" and a "nightmare," maybe a little introspection is in order.
Have you tried using a case statement that checks \_N\_?
Now you're just being obtuse and offensive. You can assuredly do very complex calculations in fortran, cobol, and assembly too. It would suck, but sure it's possible. That doesn't mean you would want to.
How can I use _N_ to grab the previous value of WANT to calculate the current value of WANT? 
Oh sorry, I misunderstood. Are you using Retain WANT to try to carry over the value and then manipulate it?
I've been assigning LAG(WANT) to a new variable to force it to execute for every record. If I put the variable before the WANT calculation then the whole column is null. If I place it after, then it works for one subsequent record before deviating from expectations. 
I've never used LAG before, so I'm not sure how to make it work as you want it to. Have you used Retain Want like I suggested? That carries the value over for each row.
I will be trying that out next. Really frustrated that I haven't been able to use LAG to do it. Excel does it so easily.
Maybe just let create a new column C and have it retain B. Then assign WANT with the max function of A+B vs C
Any licensed version of Base SAS 9.4+, or it comes built in with SAS University Edition.
Python and Jupiter notebook are open source projects with no company behind them, so there are no real licensing issues to worry about. Jupyter notebook runs almost every popular language (python obviously, java, c++, javascript, etc).
You could use the technique I used in this example to add state outlines to a county map... https://blogs.sas.com/content/sastraining/2017/03/23/creating-heat-maps-with-proc-sgplot/
I ended up using this setup basically. https://www.lexjansen.com/sesug/2015/RV-204.pdf I prefer that graph appearance (the one you provided) but it seemed like more work to get the bolder borders to be on the exact county clusters I wanted.
I'm not sure the values you've shown in WANT match the rules you state in your text."Grouping by ID, WANT is A+B for the first record of each ID. For the subsequent records of each ID, WANT is the greater of the previous value of WANT or A+B. What is a good method to get SAS to use the previous value in my example?" How would the second to last instance of ID = 1 return a 27? Shouldn't return a 25?
data mydata; input ID A B; cards; 1 0 7 1 10 15 1 20 2 1 30 20 2 0 12 2 10 12 2 20 12 2 30 12 2 40 4 ; run; data two; set mydata; by ID; retain WANT ; if first.ID then WANT = A + B; if WANT &gt; A+ B then WANT = WANT; else WANT = A+ B ; run; proc print noobs; run;
It is always much harder to report what is *not* there than what *is* there. I have a general strategy, but I am not in love with it. Let's start with a copy of your data: data before; length individual $1; informat usage_dt init_dt date9.; format usage_dt init_dt date9.; input individual usage_dt init_dt days pre3 pre2 pre1 usage; datalines; A 30-JUN-2018 04JUL2018 5 . . 1 15 A 15-JUN-2018 04JUL2018 384 1 . . 2 ; run; proc sort data=before; by individual init_dt; run; It will be easier going ahead to know which observation (e.g. Pre1-Pre3) is being stored, so let's create a flag for that: data before(drop=i); set before; array p {3} pre1-pre3; do i = 1 to 3; if (p{i} = 1) then flag = i; end; run; Now we will create some empty observations that will "fill in" any records that actually should be missing: proc sort data=before(keep=individual init_dt) out=uniq nodupkey; by individual init_dt; run; data fillin(keep=individual init_dt pre: usage flag); set uniq; array p {3} pre1-pre3; usage = 0; do i = 1 to 3; do j = 1 to 3; p{j} = .; end; p{i} = 1; flag = i; output; end; run; Finally we will add the blank rows to the original dataset and sort them so that observations that actually have a usage value greater than 0 will come first. We will finally loop through the data one last time and only keep the first record for each flag. proc sort data=after; by individual init_dt flag descending usage; run; data after(drop=flag); set after; by individual init_dt flag descending usage; if (first.flag); run; Not particularly beautiful, but the general concept is to create missing values for each situation, but then always keeping in mind that you will need a way to determine whether you want to keep those records or the original (real) data.
Thank you for the thorough explanation. I may be missing something here but when I run this (rather, some variation), my values for usage are all 0 and I now have extra lines where I shouldn't. I presented an easier case with pre1-pre3, but in my data I have pre10-post7 (18 variables including initiation period). I figured the same logic would apply but am I wrong? I think I lost you in the "empty values" section. 
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
Proc Timeseries can do this for you if you need 0 value transactions over time. http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/etsug/63939/HTML/default/viewer.htm#etsug_timeseries_sect043.htm
One thought might be to transpose your data, then use RETAIN or LAG to process through the data in a data step.
You can use LAG - the problem (without seeing your code) is that LAG by definition doesn't work on the first row of a data set. What is there to pull using the LAG function if there is no prior data? Are you familiar with FIRST. and LAST. (read as "first dot" and "last dot") logic? How the logic works is that every new value of whatever group you choose (kind of like a group by in a SQL select query) resets the FIRST. flag in SAS. You can take advantage of this by forcing the LAG() function to return a null value every time the first value of your group pops up. Then use LAG as normal for the other rows in your data. Since I'm assuming you want to reset LAGWANT for every new ID value, you're going to want to do something like this: &amp;#x200B; \*\* sort data by ID \*\*; proc sort data=\_data\_; by id; run; &amp;#x200B; \*\* use FIRST. and LAG to generate values as needed \*\*; data \_want\_; set \_data\_; by id; if [first.id](https://first.id) then do; lagwant = .; end; lagwant = lag(want); run; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Just in case someone comes along in the future and sees this response, I want to point out that this does not make sense. I don't mean to be pedantic, but it's important to understand why this doesn't work. By using the phrase "CASE statement", I am assuming you are referring to a PROC SQL call. The row identifier \_N\_ gets created by SAS during data step execution. Meaning if you are using PROC SQL to create data, \_N\_ will not be created. 
First question in programming.."how would you do it by hand?" Based on this data you mention, it is not clear how you would figure that out...so can you provide a toy example?
So the steps I had in mind was first establish the conditional in which I would gather those who have used the product. Then there would be another conditional saying I'd the last statement was true, that they did use the product, it would have to be within 90 days of the date they documented hair growth. I forgot to add that Id have that too 
Something like this: data new; set old; used_in_last_90_days = ifn(date_of_last_use ge date_of_last_use - 90, 1, 0); run; If you want 3 months instead of 90 days then check the intnx function. 
&gt;I thought about learning CDISC. Maybe, I should do that on the side. 
What industry?
I work in healthcare. i am more focused on public health but I am working on expanding into biotech/pharma. 
I said CASE, but I meant a SELECT WHEN statement. Just thinking of common language - my bad.
Usually pharma or CRO roles. I’ve seen mostly US and Europe based required, never fully remote. 
SAS hires a decent amount of remote employees. If you send me your resume and any positions you're interested in I can review and reach out to the hiring manager internally.
It’s significantly easier to answer your question if you provide sample data and expected results. Fake data is fine. 
That's the easiest of the list. And pharma is struggling to find CDISC qualified professionals 
I know a few insurance companies hire full time wfh, Aetna and anthem come to mind. 
Which skills?
Sure
Enterprise Miner, SAS MOMA, SAS CIS, SAS VA, SAS GRID, SAS RTDM, SAS FMS
When say SAS hires lot of remote employees .. is it the sas institute or are you referring to pharma or cro ?
SAS Institute
I use to work for a CRO and half of the stats programmer's in the biostats department worked remotely all across the US. The work was really boring though.
That returns the year of the current date. For example, today it would return 2019, based on the computer's current time and date.
The starting value of year will be the current year. The loop increments year one unit at a time from this starting value. Helpful?
Today() would give today's date. Year() returns year part from the input date to year() Similarly, day() and month()
In case clarification is needed: The first capitalized 'Year' is a variable. It's being assigned the value of 'year(today())', which is like saying "what's the year of today's date?". You're left with a variable called Year, which contains the number 2019.
Ok sounds good. 
I'm going to place a mini block of data upon people's request. 
I'll b giving a small table as an example 
Increment each year till total costs by year is greater than income. This gives you the time range in tears before cost exceeds income. 
Look into "prxmatch" and regular expressions. Something like: 'if prxmatch("/VW|VV|2Z|KX|6G/",variable)=0 then delete;' would keep only observations where those letters appear next to each other. If they need to be at the beginning of the string, the first argument to prxmatch would be "/\^(VW|VV|2Z|KX|6G)/" 
Something like this should work: ``` data work.have; length Case $2 Variable $10; input Case $ Variable $; datalines; 1 @@@@@@@@@@ 2 VW@@@@@@@ 3 @@@@@@@@@@ 4 VV@@@@@@@ 5 @@@@@@@@@@ 6 2Z@@@@@@@ 7 @@@@@@@@@@ 8 KX@@@@@@@ 9 @@@@@@@@@@ 10 6G@@@@@@@ ; run; data work.want; set work.have; match = prxmatch("/VW|VV|2Z|KX|6G/", Variable); if match then output; else delete; drop match; run; ```
It is trying to capture the current year \[today's year\] into a variable called "Year". IMHO, this is some bush league programming, using variable names that are the same as function names leads to potential problems down the road.
I don't know why someone downvoted you. You went out of your way to post a full implementation of how it might work. Solid effort. I love perl and have been a devotee for decades, but I have never been in love with how SAS implements perl regex. It might be old fashioned, but I think a more old school SAS version is cleaner. data have(keep=Case Variable searchTxt); length Case $2 Variable $10 searchTxt $2 codeList $40; input Case $ Variable $; codeList = "VW|VV|2Z|KX|6G"; codes = countw(codeList, "|"); do i = 1 to codes; searchTxt = scan(codeList, i, "|"); put i; put searchTxt; if (index(Variable, searchTxt) &gt; 0) then output; end; datalines; 1 @@@@@@@@@@ 2 VW@@@@@@@ 3 @@@@@@@@@@ 4 VV@@@@@@@ 5 @@@@@@@@@@ 6 2Z@@@@@@@ 7 @@@@@@@@@@ 8 KX@@@@@@@ 9 @@@@@@@@@@ 10 6G@@@@@@@ ; run; proc print; run; 
Regarding the down votes, :shrug:. While I agree that SAS regular expression support is not great, for your use case the simple RegExp works great. 
Absolutely. I quickly reach a point in programming however when I think *if I’m going to use perl then I’m just going to use perl*. In this case sed is the ultimate answer. I usually start any project with a makefile and break up the code and input / output files so that if I change something in the middle I only need to re-run the steps after that. That sounds like a bit of overhead, but on the plus side I can mix a lot of different tools depending on what they do best. 
Thank you so much!
Thank you so much!
Yeah, I got a lot out of His book as well. Dynamic Marcos are where it's at! One of first books I read when I started working with SAS last July.
Brilliant. I was looking for this! Got it! Thank you so much. 
Yes very much. I was just confused with how the parentheses was used with respect to Today. 
So it’s essentially like asking what year is today’s date and then incrementing it by an year every year?
Yup
I’m completely new to coding. So I’m still trying to figure my way out. Thank you for the tip. How can I be more efficient in this? Should I be using different variable names? You’re right it did manage to confuse me. 
Perfect! This helped me. Thank you! 🙂
Was gonna suggest prxmatch as well... It's quite powerful.
Healthcare, Pharmaceutical, and Financial Service companies will be your best bet. 
2a) DATA CLASS1; --Create a dataset called class1 SET CLASS; --Set this equal to the dataset named class BY AGE NAME; --Where class is sorted by age, name IF FIRST.AGE=0 THEN OUTPUT; -- If not the first age, then output. RUN; &amp;#x200B; FIRST.AGE returns 1 if the observation is the youngest/first age, or 0 if they are not. So this code is just removing all students that are the youngest age (ie the 11-year-olds) &amp;#x200B; 2b) In order to run the above code, CLASS must be sorted by age, name (using proc sort)
Also idk if teacher is testing on being sneaky. Your missing a couple “;” In 2A. There should be a ; at the end of the data lines derivations. And after run for best practice. 2b) dory by age name (no comma) just in case you add comma. 
Hi, there is no need for $ after name. It is already present after the next variable.
Absolutely, glad to be useful. I'm no SAS genius by any means, so I am all too familiar with your frustration sometimes. :)
Hahaha. Yes it can get really frustrating sometimes. I intend to take up the SAS certification exam and want to leave no room of doubt whatsoever. It’s an expensive exam here in India. Costs around 15K in my currency! 😅 
There are many schools of thought on this, and a lot of it depends on the language and the traditions. I am a bit old school, so in SAS anyways I always start my variables with "v\_", so that when I see "v\_Year" I know that it is not to be confused with the function Year. It also makes it easier to search through code and do replacements if needed. Learn to use Labels in SAS for the presentation layer so you don't get reports that show "v\_Year", "v\_Profit", "v\_Cost"....but "Current Year", "Net Profit Gained", "Total Cost Expended"
Wowzers! Yeah, I would want to make sure I knew everything too! :)
2A - It removes the first record for every age 2B - Sort the data by AGE and NAME &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Because homogeneity of varience is an assumption for regression.
Thanks so much!
Not to double post, but also having the same issue with running an ANOVA in the same situation.
Is area continuous or are they both categorical?
Both categorical
Then proc freq with /chisq aught to produce the chi square value and a p value, doesn't it do that?
Yes, it does, however, I want to do this by level. This chi square only performs it for each variable, and not within the levels of the variable.
Maybe add a BY statement for the Group variable? You would have to sort by the variable as well.
No it doesn’t at least not with the code shown. Show your results if you need help with interpretation. SAS has a free statistics course if you need it.
I am looking for code for interpreting several level codes. This is the code I get from running this: [https://imgur.com/a/YS5lcfc](https://imgur.com/a/YS5lcfc) . Can anything be gleaned from this about level-specific data?
^(Hi, I'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image) **https://i.imgur.com/DvduQmU.png** ^^[Source](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot) ^^| ^^[Why?](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot/blob/master/README.md) ^^| ^^[Creator](https://np.reddit.com/user/AUTplayed/) ^^| ^^[ignoreme](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&amp;subject=ignoreme&amp;message=ignoreme)^^| ^^[deletthis](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&amp;subject=delet%20this&amp;message=delet%20this%20ekg63az)
I have done that, but the problem is, one of the levels has no F value, no nothing. I'm assuming it's because it's a binary variable, and the counts are only within one of the strata.
I think it has to do with storing the WORK. data sets when running your project and running out of space.
I've tried doing the data manipulation by month individually and combining them with a data step at the end. I am still running into the issue but am able to process 4-5 work.dataset before getting the same issue (unfortunately this is only 50% of the data..). Could this error be system RAM/processing related?
I did run into a similar issue relating to HD running out of space (temporary/work was on C drive before) but have since changed the directory to a different drive with alot of free space.. so yea I'm with you not sure what is causing this. maybe my current computer isn't able to handle this many records..
The chi-square test is a test for independence. The null hypothesis is that the two variables are independent (in other words, the values of Group have no knfluence on the values of Area The results of the test are provided to you in the output, so you should look into what those mean. What you might be looking for is a test of proportions. Then you can say, within each level of Group, are the proportions of Area the same or not. This might help? https://communities.sas.com/t5/Statistical-Procedures/Testing-the-equality-of-2-proportions-Chi-square-Z-test/td-p/346497
I think if you were running out of disk space you would also see the error message "ERROR: Insufficient space in file [WORK.XXXX.DATA](https://WORK.XXXX.DATA)". So, then it would be pretty clear what the issue is.
What version of SAS and on what platform? When talking about I/O errors these are key bits of information.
You have 1TB of space available, but SAS also has a logical limit of how big a work library can get. Are you running on a Server using a client like SAS Enterprise Guide or SAS Studio, or are you running Base SAS? What's [Memsize](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/hostwin/69955/HTML/default/viewer.htm#n0srij4mcdpzv2n1vtphltb00xjw.htm) set to? How about [Utilloc](https://go.documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=lesysoptsref&amp;docsetTarget=p1texr4rxo0ipyn1ovajj11raccx.htm&amp;docsetVersion=9.4&amp;locale=en)?
I believe its sas 9.4 on Windows
Im running base sas 9.4. Will check those 2 when i get into the office tomorrow. Thanks!
My guess is it's probably an issue with utilloc. Also I was wrong, there is no logical limit for the size of a work table, but utilloc is used when doing things like joining and memsize is the memory limit. There's also REALMEMSIZE if memsize looks ok
You can do the anova using Proc Reg, and then do a White's test. [https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63347/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug\_reg\_sect042.htm](https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63347/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_reg_sect042.htm)
Bayes' Law https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem
**Bayes' theorem** In probability theory and statistics, Bayes' theorem (alternatively Bayes' law or Bayes' rule) describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. For example, if cancer is related to age, then, using Bayes' theorem, a person's age can be used to more accurately assess the probability that they have cancer, compared to the assessment of the probability of cancer made without knowledge of the person's age. One of the many applications of Bayes' theorem is Bayesian inference, a particular approach to statistical inference. When applied, the probabilities involved in Bayes' theorem may have different probability interpretations. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/sas/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Awesome thank you. I find studying the crap out of something is the best way to guarantee it won't show up on your next exam attempt.
Another reason not to trust these certification exams, someone almost qualified as a Certified Statistical Business Analyst, yet is not aware of Bayes' Law? Soft of like calling certifying a financial planner, that has no idea what an IRA is....
That's a bummer. I went through my entire SAS course and never saw a mention of it.
Not faulting you, just saying SAS is going to lose their credibility when someone shows up claiming to be a "Certified SBA" and then gets laughed out the interview when they fail open on a conditional probability question as not even knowing Bayes' equation. False sense of certification on SAS' part, big disservice to people taking the exams.
What format is your CCTV footage in?
This sounds more or less what I am trying to do. Will give it a try tomorrow

Thanks Dude! turns out memory may have been the culprit. I bumped it up to 5Gb and it seemed to have fixed it.
Is it uncompressed AVI? What are you attempting to train it on?

Because the result columns you want are separate groupings of variables, you're going to have to create the result columns you want in separate passes through the data. I suggest creating a base table that has the base columns, then using PROC SQL to generate the columns you want in separate queries. Then join to the base table on the appropriate columns. You can do the same thing using multiple data steps and merges, and functionally it's the same thing, but I simply prefer PROC SQL for that kind of data manipulation.

I am using SAS 9.4 :)
Check out [this](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Data-Management/Running-total/td-p/135445) thread on creating running totals using data step.
F3 Runs selection. If nothing is selected it runs the whole program. I don’t use F8, but aim sure its in the docs.
I don't have SAS in front of me, so this is from memory, and seeing the totals in Location_Cumulative_Sum_Want*, i'm not 100% sure what you're calculating. If you want to group by Location, shouldn't the London lines be 350? But here's this and you can tweak the grouping to see if you can get it the way you want. proc sql; create table grouptest as select Sale_Date, Cash_Received_Date, Cash_Amount, Location, Item, User_Ready, sum(cash_amount) as Location_Cumulative_Sum_Want from tablename group by location; quit;
You're missing a semicolon at the end of your first array statement. And I think the only way you're going to br able to declare tt as a variable in the array is if you create it as a macro variable. That's going to require that you create the sums array in a separate data step.
Sorry for the slow reply. I tried your code and it doesn't appear to give me the sum. It just outputs the last observation instead of summing the columns, like this: &amp;#x200B; |A|B|C|1|2|3|4|5| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |A1|B1|C1|0|1|0|0|0| |A2|B2|C2|0|0|0|0|1|
There is not much we can do without a sample of your code and at least a few lines of the data. Help us help you.
My guess is that it is being read in as character data which has a default length of 8, hence you are only getting the 8 characters. You could add a length statement to specify a length of 10 or import with a date informat (not sure which one off the top of my head).
Definitely check the length you're assigning. Odds are it's coming as character like mentioned above which means it's counting the /s. After you change the length to 10, after the line, you can add: date2=input(date,mmddyy10.); That should convert it to a numeric date field for you.
That isn't the result I got when I run it. You can see my full program and results [here](https://keybase.pub/mts/retain_sum.html). Now, to explain myself. data combined; set original; by A B C; array OPTCOV {5} _1-_5; array SUMS {5} sum1-sum5; You probably know what's going on here, but for the sake of thoroughness, I'm creating the dataset combined, reading from the dataset original. Using the BY statement signals to SAS that the input dataset (original) is sorted by the variables A, B, and C. This will enable me to make use of [BY-group processing](https://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=lrcon&amp;docsetTarget=p0e9b2d12lpyjkn1b0y1tqg6q146.htm&amp;docsetVersion=9.4&amp;locale=en), which is important later. The array statements group the variables _1 through _5 (the values of which I intend to sum) and the variables sum1 through sum5 (new variables where I will store the summed values). do i = 1 to 5; if first.A then SUMS{i} = 0; SUMS{i} + OPTCOV{i}; end; This DO loop iterates across my arrays. The variable first.A is enabled by listing A in the BY statement above. It has a value of 1 at the start of a given value of A and zero otherwise. So, the IF statement sets the elements of the sums array to zero whenever the value of A changes. This ensures that I don't accidentally sum across groups. The next part, `SUMS{i} + OPTCOV{i};` is what's known as a [SUM statement](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrdict/64316/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a000289454.htm). Basically, this increases the current value of each SUMS variable by the value of the respective OPTCOV variable, and then retains the new value for the next iteration of the data step. if last.A then output; Similar to first.A, last.A is set to 1 when we reach the last occurrence of a particular value of A, and zero otherwise. This statement causes the data step to only output at the bottom of a group (when we've finished summing). drop i _1-_5; run; Finally, the drop statement tells SAS not to output certain variables to the dataset I'm creating. Specifically, I'm dropping the values that have been summed up, and my array index. If you want to better visualize what the DATA step is doing on each iteration, try removing or commenting out the line with the OUTPUT and the DROP statement and look at the resulting dataset.
I agree, isn't it VarName 10. or something similar? Get the characters in and then format them into another variable that stores them as a SAS datetime thingie and then you're golden. Or do what herbwannabe says below and go straight to datetime format, I think it will see mmddyyyy8. but it could be 10., it's still stored as a numaric count of "days since january 1, 1960".
Before the input you would have Length varname $10; to get the length. I think if you want to read it in as a date initially, you could do something like this to specify the informat: Input varname anydtdte10.;
They are similar but unexpectedly both of them malfunction sometimes. I’ll try to do a showcase once i catch it again
Not exactly what you asked for, but one thing you can do is compress your SAS datasets. Disk I/O is frequently a bottleneck for large datasets. Put the following at the top of your program: options compress=binary; Compressed SAS datasets work exactly like normal ones; every PROC is fine with it. I'm frankly surprised compress=binary is not the default in SAS.
Try ``` %macro read_a(data_name, array_name, array_variables); data test; set &amp;data_name; array &amp;array_name [*] &amp;array_variables; run; %mend read_a; data new; x1=12; x2=4; x3=10.5; run; %read_a(data_name=new, array_name=list, array_variables=x1-x3); proc print data=test; run; ```
I checked the docs. F3 and F8 do the same thing. This is expected behaviour is you don’t have anything selected. Not a bug.
Let's forget about F8. The bug is that F3 sometimes runs the whole project while inside the Program (where you write code and select) If you don't select particular code and want to run the whole code on your screen, hit F3, 1 out of 50 it will run the whole project (20-30 programs in my case).
is there any downsides to using compress=binary?
Create a view possibly?
There are no arrays in the macro language, so if you want to pass an array you will need to create a series of macro parameters and populate them with the individual data step array elements one at a time.
 %macro read_a(data_name, array_name, array_variables); data test; set &amp;data_name; array &amp;array_name [*] &amp;array_variables; run; %mend read_a; data new; x1=12; x2=4; x3=10.5; run; %read_a(data_name=new, array_name=list, array_variables=x1-x3); proc print data=test; run;
More CPU resources are needed to read a compressed file. See http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrdict/64316/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a001288760.htm
You can even loop them like this: %macro arrays; %do i = 1 %to 5; call symput("macrovar&amp;i.", arrayname(&amp;i.)); %end; %mend arrays; %arrays; run;
Our install of Grid has it as the default. The one possibility that it might not be optimal is if your data has a lot of character variables. In that case, CHAR might be better than BINARY.
After some more research; If you make a selection and hit F3 it will run the selection. If nothing is selected, and the program is active, F3 runs the whole program. If you are on the process flow screen, or that part of your screen is active and hit F3, it will run the whole project.
Here's link to discussion [SAS Forum](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SASware-Ballot-Ideas/Change-F3-Behavior-to-exclude-quot-Run-Entire-Process-Flow-quot/idi-p/219984)
Thank you for looking further into the matter. This is also how I expect it to behave and it does in 98% of cases. Sometimes it runs the whole project even though I'm inside of a program with nothing selected. hence this post. I'll upload a video once I catch it.
I have got to see this. That would be very annoying.
Actually, you could also do something like this... array t(*) a b c; do i = 1 to dim(t); call symput(compress("macrovar"||i),t{i}); end; This would create macrovar1, macrovar2, etc. dynamically based on the number of elements in the array.
Yes, good point. That would be even better.
There isn’t a way to see them side by side as far as I know. But you could use proc print for datasets and select certain variables to look at side by side
That’s a good idea I didn’t think about that. Thanks!
But why would you want to avoid it? It’s a really good skill and certainly not a difficult language to learn. My question aside, maybe convincing them to get SAS Visual Analytics?
I'll ignore the snark of your comment and suggest [SASPy](https://github.com/sassoftware/saspy): &gt; This module allows a python process to connect to SAS 9.4 and run SAS code, generated by the supplied object and methods or explicitly user written, and returns results as text, HTML5 documents (via SAS ODS), or as Pandas Data Frames. It supports running analytics and returning the resulting graphics and result data. It can convert between SAS Data Sets and Pandas Data Frames. It has multiple access methods which allow it to connect to local or remote Linux SAS, IOM SAS on Windows or Linux (Including Grid Manager), and local PC SAS. It can run w/in Jupyter Notebooks, in line mode python or in python batch scripts. It is expected that the user community can and will contribute enhancements.
great suggestion thanks! Sorry if I offended you, I just want a transferable skillset for the future, and that does not include SAS. Specifically, I'm looking to transition from biotech data management to med tech development and work experience in SAS will be nearly worthless in that subsector
I'm looking to transition to med tech development and any SAS work experience won't be transferable in the same way python/R/etc is
Will someone be taking over your code when you leave? If so, then you have a bit of an obligation to use the organizational norms for your programs. So, if your company is formally a SAS shop you need to program in SAS...and trying to shoehorn everything into PROC SQL doesn't count as SAS programming.
I found dataframes in pandas to be similar to sas datasets. Very useful. If you're more of a proc sql person than a data step person then pandas is your friend. You'll miss being able to use lag and similar tools to work across rows; get used to making a lot of joins. Now that I'm used to it, I only use SAS when I don't have a choice. Python is fantastic.
Ah got it. I have no experience in that field but one thing I’ve learned in my field (insurance) is that SQL is pretty universal across fields and you can write SQL in SAS, as you noted. You can also use SQL in R with the correct libraries. Oh, if your company uses one of the newest versions of SAS, I believe it will run R programs. I don’t know the technical ins and outs, but that may be a way to get better with R and satisfy the SAS requirement as well.
I'm one of 2 or 3 programmers at the company, and the only one that will be expected to fully shift to SAS. All our tech decisions are made by non-programmers, so it will be m ore/less my call what counts as a SAS program - if it's a SAS script and it runs in SAS...count it!
Yeah that's why I was excited about the python &gt; SQL package. It hits a lot of boxes: technically still generates SAS executable code, python looks great where I'm trying to go and SQL is a basic programming skill. Thanks!
Learning a programming language is not a zero-sum game - learning one does not erase another from memory. Those of us that have been programming for years recognize that there are several styles of programming languages and when the next one comes along it is just a matter of learning the syntax. I suspect you'll come across SAS code in the future anyway ... it is the COBOL of the 21st Century.
