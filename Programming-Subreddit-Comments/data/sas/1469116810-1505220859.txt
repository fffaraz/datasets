 format start_date yymmdd10.; 
Thank you very much! So, can I have the following length statement with numeric 5 for yymmdd10. format? length Start_Date 5.; Also, what if info record on the input file doesn't have days or months and just has zeros instead? Would yymmdd10. format fix that on the output file? Example of input file info record=&gt; 20160000 
If you can combine ARC GIS with SAS, that's a really valuable skillset in mapping related fields, especially when they end up with data they can't handle in ARC GIS (because a lot of people know that software already). If you can learn to deal with big data and messy data, there may even be jobs in geology. I'm not familiar with the field, but mapping is big now, and SAS is a great tie in skill.
I made a mistake above and I can't count - it's yymmdd8. as the format, and not yymmdd10. It doesn't hurt you, but you don't need it. The length for a variable is the number of bytes, not the number of digits. For a character variable, that happens to line up with its length, so length myString $8.; gives us a character variable that takes up 8 bytes (Which happens to be 8 characters). By default, SAS assigns numeric variables as length 8. If the raw data in the input is in the format yyyymmdd, then you can read it in with: input start_date yymmdd8.; That tells SAS to read the input_date field as if it were the format listed, yymmdd8. If the record on the input is missing some stuff like you showed, the informat would not fix anything. That's a data quality issue. SAS can't just guess what you mean by 20160000, so you'll have to write some code to account for possible data quality issues.
The sub query to get the minimum date is a different scope than the main query, and would have no idea what the table 'a' is that is supposed to be referenced. Also, is the reference to a = b necessary to get the minimum date?
My apologies. This will run on Sybase: select a.*, b.date, b.indicator from #temptable a left join table2 b on a.key = b.key and b.date = (select min(b2.date) from table2 b2 where b.key = b2.key and b2.indicator = 1) But, when I run it in SAS with PROC SQL after creating tables and replacing the #temptable.. the result set seems to hang?
Awesome, thanks for the reply! 
That'll work, but keep in mind, the way you did it, start_date is not a date field. It's just a number, and it won't (easily) convert to a date, even if it's valid, like 20160721, rather than 20160000.
Since you're planning to change field, have you thought of becoming a statistician in your field? More stable than SAS programmer. In some industries, companies are changing to R programming from SAS. Programming languages will change in time and new language will replace the current one in the market. Self study plan: 1. Base SAS certification book is enough to take base certification exam. If you study 8 hours every day, you'll be able to take the quiz in 4 weeks time. Check out SAS website for free tutorials. Check university websites for SAS examples and quizzes. https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat480/node/9. 2. Advance SAS certification: this will take some time and a little longer than base. Go through the SAS tutorials and sample/practice quizzes before buying books from Amazon. Check out libraries, SAS website, online materials and used books before spending money on SAS books. 
Yes, I agree that programming languages change. I need a good start with anything, and then go on from there I guess. Once you've learned one language the next one might be easier I suppose. At least I once solved a riddle in R once. Not that it helps a lot... Base SAS: Looking at the UK sas website I see that two 'courses' combine into the base programmer. Do I understand this correctly? http://www.sas.com/offices/europe/uk/education/paths/prg.html Yes, learning from a book and running SAS from a VM on my computer would be my preference. For this I'd not even need to touch my training budget but could get some project management certificate and maybe even still something else instead. Need to look into this: Scrum or Agile seems to be popular in Finance and IT in the UK. 
I went through the link. Don't spend money for Base SAS. The link I had sent should cover Base Certification material. I don't thinks scrum and agile apply to SAS, I was under the impression they apply to Java and other development projects. PMP certification requires management experience. 
No, I don't intend to spend money on the base. I was just curious on what it covers. And yes, I do have extensive project management experience, just no certification. Not sure though if I really want to do anything with that. 
http://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2015/10/05/random-integers-sas.html This is a good strategy. If your min and max values change with subsequent updates, you're going to have to write additional code to call and store the updated values in a macro variable.
Kruskal Wallis test
I studied from the prep guide before taking the certification, I also had the multiple choice Q&amp;A dump pdf from a friend (this was long ago,I don't have the link for it anymore). Buy the used book or if you can get it from a library, once you get good at it you won't refer to it later. You can look at the first chapter here and see if it works for you. http://support.sas.com/publishing/pubcat/chaps/59332.pdf Also go through the link in my comment as well for base certification. It's designed to help with base certification. 
The certification prep guide is very thorough, I'd say you can pass the exam with just that and the free online materials. As long as you put the time and effort in :) Good luck!
You'll see that statement often with PROC SPLOT; I've hit that twice in the past month. They've made a ton of changes there lately. The slight issue I'm having is making sure other people upgrade if they use my code. :/
If you change `%do j = 8 %to 1;` to `%do j = 8 %to 1 %by -1;` or simply `%do j = 1 %to 8;` the code should behave as you expect. However, I'd argue that there's no need to use macro logic here - it complicates your code unnecessarily. I'd suggest writing a data step loop and leaving macros out of it: data test1; set counter_apps; /*Initial debug value assignment*/ Data_Consol = 'No-pop'; /*Logic to work top down to compensate for doubling up of values*/ do i = 1 to 4 while(Data_Consol = 'No-pop'); * Minor optimisation - exit the outer loop on pass; do j = 1 to 8; if(counter = j and Nbrassociations = i) then Data_Consol = 'Pass'; end; end; drop i j; run; I've also reversed your inner loop as it makes no difference which order it runs in, and it will increment by +1 by default, avoiding the need for a `by` expression. 
Performance wise I think they'll be similar. I think SQL uses more resources compared to data step in SAS because of opening the engine, I'm not sure if this has changed lately. Similarly, hash also uses more resources because of the index created. If readability and maintenance is the reason, then look into tabs and adding more comments and white space to help with readability. 
In R it'd be easiest/best to simply create a list of key-value pairs (the key being the conditional, the value being the resulting function/value). An R list would be a close approximation to a dictionary, except it'd be faster with under a couple hundred pairs (and ordered). An R list can accept any data type, so it'd be extremely flexible and easy to work with. You could even store *all* of the blocks within the same list if you wanted to. There are probably better ways (perhaps just the usual R vectorization), but that'd be my first thought.
Wouldn't SAS format be the same as R list? It would be helpful if you could provide sample code that you're trying to reduce. 
What are you trying to model? There were so few details here...
This depends on a number of factors, where is the data stored, what is the disk speed of saswork and the source data directories if it is all in SAS datasets, can proc SQL execute the code natively in the DBMS or does it need to pull the data to the SAS server and execute it there because a certain function is used. There are some profiling tools in DI studio that allow you to analyze where your code is executing and where the data ends up going. There are also some options for proc sql that I can dig up at work tomorrow.
&gt; hash also uses more resources because of the index created Hash joins require more CPU and memory than normal merges but they do not require an index, unless we have very different understandings of the term.
Thank you very much! It looks like it is all working already. 
Full reproduction steps and output at each stage please.
Thanks! Do you personally think it's something to worry about?
Yes!! I would clean the log if I get this message in my program. Basically, character variable is being converted to numeric during a numeric operation. I wouldn't want that in my program. 
Thanks. Maybe I should just take out the macro because it doesn't convert them when I leave the macro out.
I would recommend testing the macro without an array and just use the variable name. This'll help figure out which variable is producing this message. Data dout; Set din; %macro test(var=,list=); If &amp;var. in (&amp;list.) then &amp;var_flag=1; else &amp;var_flag=0; %mend; %test(var=v1, list=%str(1,2,3)); Run; 
Thanks! I'll give this a try tomorrow :)!
Just because you can separate them in your head doesn't mean that SAS was built to separate them in its memory.
To be honest, quirks like this in SAS, and indeed in most common programming languages, are not the result of conscious design to allow or prevent certain behaviours, they're the result of things being cobbled together since the 60s and features being tacked on with varying degrees of consideration and checking whether it breaks anything.
Thank you for your reply! It seems like this technique worked!
I am still having issues with this C function but since no one reply with their experiences I just decided to delete my question at the end of the day. I noticed that usually reddit users comment only in the first day and then questions just hanging there. But, please do let me know if you know the answer! 
This is a highly technical problem - unless you post exhaustive details of everything you've done and the exact output you got at each stage, it is highly unlikely that anyone will attempt to help you, still less actually be able to do so.
Your answer is right, it should be 20, not 15 since the length occurs before the merge statement. No explanation except the answer in the official SAS practice exam is incorrect. Highly unusual.
Where can I take this exam? Sorry if this isn't a good place to ask
Great to hear it :) Good luck with your analysis!
Google!!! https://support.sas.com/certify/creds/bp.html
I usually use the concatenation function and excel for this
You can save a lot of time. Use macro variables
PROC tabulate data=data; Class system measure; Table System ,measure*percentn; Run; Something like that. I forget the exact.
It's ridiculous how useful Excel is for preparing/formatting statements for SAS. I'm almost ashamed at how much I use it. :P
Data final; Run; %macro test; %do I=1 %to ; Data dset&amp;i. ; Set din&amp;i. ; varc ="system &amp;i"; Varn = varn&amp;i.; Run; Data final; Set final dset&amp;i.; Run; %end; %mend; 
The most important thing to know about macros is that it's just a fancy way to generate text. So my macro renlist is a function that takes in two variables - called oldvars and newvars - and spits out some text that SAS will then run as code. The first bit of the macro function just sets up i as a macro variable within the function (i.e. it's "local" to the function, so if it turns out there's a really important macro variable named i elsewhere in your code its value won't be affected). The %scan function pulls out the i-th "word" in its first parameter. So the condition on the do loop sees if oldvars has an i-th word (i.e. it checks if it's "not equal to"/ne blank text). If so, then we produce the text given by pulling out the i-th words of oldvars and newvars, and separating them with an equals sign (and I've realised there shouldn't be a semicolon at the end of that line, so take that out or terrible things will happen). For example, if oldvars = a1 a2 a3 and newvars = b1 b2 b3, then when i = 1 that line produces "a1 = b1". Then when i = 2 it gives "a2 = b2", and so forth. Then the next line adds one to i, so that when we loop around we'll be checking the next pair of variable names.
Can you please provide me with an example code? Im not well versed in TABULATE let alone REPORT haha. 
Yes! You can find sample questions [here](http://support.sas.com/certify/creds/samples/), and a practice exam is available [here](https://support.sas.com/edu/schedules.html?ctry=us&amp;id=851) as well. Hope this helps, and good luck! 
What's the error message you're getting? I'm assuming &amp;tab1, &amp;tab2, &amp;tab3 and &amp;tab4 and &amp;data1 to 4 are defined outside the macro?
Have you tried changing the file to a .csv and then use proc import. There's something in SAS EG that has trouble importing xlsm. Not sure what. 
It will work fine that way; was just hoping to avoid it since there's multiple tabs I need to import and would have to save each as their own csv. The data is also coming from another country which kind of adds complexity to because of the formats.
In that case, save a copy of the xlsm file as .csv and import it using proc import. It should work. I saw this as an issue in one of the companies I worked at when they changed from PC SAS to server SAS EG. You don't have to save individual sheets as csv only have to change the extension of the file. 
All but the first sheet won't disappear? I thought you couldn't have multiple sheets with CSV?
Sorry, usually when saving as csv on my work computer it doesn't allow more than one sheet in the workbook. You're saying only changing the extension will keep it ok?
OP, I assume you are running on a 64 bit machine, but what is the "bitness" of your Excel application and your SAS software? I assume this is PC SAS, not SAS on a server? 
I have had a similar problem and all the "bitnesses" have to match in order for it to work cleanly. If you have 32 bit SAS and 32 bit Excel (Everyone does unless you specifically install 64 bit Excel), then your import will work. Otherwise you have to use something called PC File Server that can start up every time your computer boots and will allow you to run 64 bit SAS and publish/import 32 bit Excel (for example). When you use this method, set your dbms = excelcs
Thanks! I'll have our IT manager look into getting us the PC File Server. 
This is possible via the use of hash objects provided that your dataset is small enough to fit in memory. I posted an example on StackOverflow but I can't be bothered can to find the link while posting from my mobile.

SAS does now have Object Oriented Language with PROC DS2. I'm not too skilled in it as I have fairly limited experience in those types of programming languages, but if you think it'd be fairly simple, that would be a good direction to go.
I'm out of my depth and someone else will probably give you a better/correct answer. But... it appears that when creating observation number 310, SAS has encountered something it doesn't like. If you check the contents of observation 309, then go back to your source file and find the matching content, shortly after that content, check for a strange character or formatting. Amending it may let you successfully read the file in, or get you a little further? If that is any help at all, then fantastic!!! If not... I'm sorry :D Edit: The odd formatting looks like it may be in the source_notes column.
There are only 216 observations :/
Please post a [minimal, complete and verifiable example](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) and I'm sure someone will be able to help you.
Thanks for this, I was able to work out my solution by cleaning up the macros, but I am excited to see what I can really get away with in the future.
Thanks for the heads-up as I had not yet heard about proc DS2, looks very useful.
you have to find the spot where it goes wrong. There are only 216 lines, you should be able to do that by manually comparing. For detecting what is there in the source file, maybe look at the file through a hex editor.
You probably have a mismatched semicolon or %end block somewhere. Check it very carefully. If not, simplify: try to run each macro by itself.
Oh yeah no. I was just trying to show that those were different macro calls. Anyways, I figured it out. I don't know what I did, but it worked so Im not going to question it. haha.
MPRINT will print the code generated by the macro called. MLOGIC will print a bunch of macro information like the resolution of a macro variable or results when macro conditions are evaluated. 
Thanks!
Proc means is what you want...
You're looking for the Cochran-Armitage Test for Trend i believe. It's in PROC FREQ: http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/procstat/63104/HTML/default/viewer.htm#procstat_freq_sect032.htm
My guess is that adding MISSOVER, LRECL=32767, etc. to your infiles will help you diagnose the issue.
I don't think this is correct. 256 isn't a maximum, it's a default. LRECL= can change that value.
Thanks!
This is what I was thinking, but the problem is that it seems to freeze the program if I even a relatively small amount of data. I ran it on 20 observations and it took a minute (on my pretty decent PC) and when I ran it on 30 observations- 15 in each group- the program froze up. is this method only applicable to a small amount of data or something?
I assume you're doing this in a data step... can you not just set the length of the variable prior to the set statement? If these are character variables, then you could always use a strip function to look for the value san any blanks.
They're character variables :/
Change it to numeric, set the format, and change it back to character.
Based on my cursory look at Wikipedia, I'd check to see if it starts with an E or V first. If it doesn't, input it to numeric and then put it into the appropriate format/length. You can even do the same by using a substr starting in position 2 with the E and V codes. For example: icd9 = trim(left(icd9)); if substr(icd9, 1, 1) in ('E', 'V') then icd9_new = substr(icd9, 1, 1) || put(input(substr(icd9, 2), 10.), 10.4); else icd9_new = put(input(substr(icd9, 2), 10.), 10.4); Choose your own format -- I just made up 10.4.
Thanks!

Large number of observations or large number of variables? or both? Are you concerned with the pain of setting up the code or computing time?
Both .... large all around. It's my first pass at multiple imputations and there seems to be so many options I don't want to go through and pick which aisle best for every variable
if your variables are named X1-x1000 then you can do this in the macro. If the variables have different names then you can do your method. %macro functions(max=); %do i =1 %to &amp;max.; Sin_x&amp;i. = sin( x&amp;i.); Cos_x&amp;i.=cos(x&amp;i.); %end; %mend; Data din; Set din; %functions(max=1000); Run; 
SAS does offer some free tutorials and e-learning courses to help you get started, see http://support.sas.com/training/us/sp1.html The SAS 9.4 SQL Procedure User's Guide may also come in handy http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/sqlproc/69049/PDF/default/sqlproc.pdf

Thank you 
Well, you could do it as a macro, like this: %macro my_ttests(classvar); PROC TTEST DATA= mydata ; VAR first_variable second_variable; CLASS &amp;classvar.; RUN; %mend; %my_ttests(first_class); %my_ttests(second_class); 
What you're looking for is called a "Transpose" in SAS. I haven't used EG in years and don't know where it is; a quick google suggested Data-&gt;Transpose, or Tasks-&gt;Describe-&gt;Summary tables Wizard. (Not sure which is correct.) In full SAS (not EG) you would use proc transpose. By the way, your english is very good.
You could use the Transpose option as /u/smileylich mentioned, but you could also do this using a data step and output statements. I prefer the data step method, but that requires you to write code, unlike the transpose option. 
Yep, or you could use proc sql to rearrange it if you want. But I think proc transpose is the best approach as that is what it is designed for so it's easier. 
Thank you very much! I think I tried that, had some kind of error and moved on to my next best hypothesis on how transform my data set :/ I'll investigate "transpose" then, thanks again for you time and your answer!
There must be typo somewhere. You'll know when you comment everything but the code you're testing. 
Or the simpler version... Var2 = var1 in(4,5) ;
(Not so) fun fact: SAS sometimes has internal issues with integer precision. It's entirely possible that your 5s are secretly 5.00000000001s which are then "not equal" to 5 and wouldn't work. To see if I'm right, stick the line "var1 = round(var1,1);" before your code and see if anything changes.
I'm on my phone but try looking up" Ods persist ". You can run tons of ttest and easily stack the output into a table. I've used it to see crude ORs with proc logistics to help me with variable selection. 
Can you explain what that logic statement does? I've also never seen the ** function. 
Thanks but this recodes case where var1 is missing to zeros for var2. I don't want this to happen (I am using the 0/1 recode to report the proportion of respondents who give the top two scale ratings.)
How big is your export/attachment file? It might be completing file operation while the next section of code is run immediately. Put 20 seconds of SLEEP between your steps and see if it changes anything. http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrdict/64316/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a001418809.htm 
Are you using ods? If yes, then make sure you close the ods before attaching....
The file being attached is 2KB
Thanks! I did install the SAS university edition actually so I can teach myself how to use the software! I'll check out the e-courses and the book! Thanks again. 
Thanks! I'll be sure to check it out! 
Can you share the code? What's the export operation?
But how are you creating the file? Is it a sas dataset that you are attaching? Could you post the code snippet if possible?
If you are with a university many of them receive access to full online Sas training. Track down your university account person and they can give you a code that unlocks the training on the SAS site. 
SAS is a tool. It's best to find what you want to do, statistician data scientist etc. Having SAS as your skill is your ability to do what you want will be the big asset.
Remember EG does not run any SAS code. EG connects to a SAS workspace session which is an instance of SAS running off of whatever your Object Spawner your setup usually through a Metadata server unless your pointed to your Local SAS executable. In the local case you have a SAS session started usually also as a workspace session. Your code should be native to whatever your workspace session is running on. Base SAS is a SAS module and SAS batch is how you call the SAS executable. So you have Base SAS running in either SAS Batch, or running through a workspace session created by EG, or SAS DM (display manager) . It's good to try to keep these terms in mind when describing environments and where your code is running. Maybe asking IT for help is a good thing ...
This depends on many things. What procedure are you running? Remember SAS data step is single threaded. other more intense algorithms may be multithreaded. Read about the SAS PDV to give you an idea what this occurs. This means only a single processor will ever run at once. Always look to see if you have use an HP Procedure as it will usually give u the best performance. The other issue you will have on Amazon is I/O issues. You need to data to the CPU fast enough. While 10 GB is small when you get to bigger data it will be an issue. The rule of thumb with SAS is that it reads between 75 to 150 MB per second per core because of storage limitations. So if your process is single threaded you should reading somewhere between that rate. Test this by doing. options fullstimer; data _null_; set (out your data here); run; And see how fast that reads. Divide size by time to give your your rate. A lot of this goes away with SAS Viya which can't come soon enough.

I think you might be in the wrong sub.
Learning SAS and taking exams are two different things. I would recommend going through and make sure you understand the concepts, don't waste your time memorising code. Then, only do practice exam questions! This way you learn taking the exam. It's normal if you will suck in the beginning. There is a great paid android app that let's you do over 100 practice questions. It helped me get a &gt;90℅ score 
Thanks a lot. I read for example: *Use INFILE statement options to control processing when reading raw data files. * Use the INFILE statement DLM= option to specify field delimiters. * Use the INFILE statement PAD= option to reading variable-length records. * Use the INFILE statement DSD= option to read data when missing values occur. * Use the INFILE statement options, FLOWOVER, MISSOVER, TRUNCOVER and STOPOVER, as appropriate to control reading records. Looking through the documentation I see quite a few other things for INFILE. Knowing them is nice, but those won't be asked during the exam but only what is mention here? This is what I mean with the thousands of tiny details. 
Of course understanding is key. I'm not someone who learns by memorizing but by understanding. Do you mind telling me the name of the app? I had a look in my iphone but found nothing useful there. But I have an android tablet. 
No no no *no*. Yes, those questions will make you a better SAS programmer in practice because they force you to think creatively, but the test itself is multiple choice and more of a tick-in-the-box validation. The test itself doesn't check if you can use your intuition to solve problems, it checks if you remember the SAS syntax and statement logic. My recommendation is to well-acquaint yourself with the PDV processing and the proper ordering of all keywords and options. In general, it's probably a good sign that you can solve the practice problems because those closely resemble the sort of problems you'll encounter in the realm of business, but it won't help you on the test. 
Oh sorry, I meant the Quiz part at the end of each chapter. Those are multiple choice, and not difficult unless I get distracted and miss a tiny detail somewhere. 
Why do you need a macro? Are you going to have more variables in future? or is it always going to be only 12 variables with same variable names? Also, why would you need sysdate?
the issue is that this program will be re-ran in the next fiscal year with another variabled added. i.e. fy18. As a result, I want it to be automated as possible so that no additional variables are needed to be created by hand.
the issue is that this program will be re-ran in the next fiscal year with another variabled added. i.e. fy18. As a result, I want it to be automated as possible so that no additional variables are needed to be created by hand. 
I plagiarized part of code from u/ChefTeo sorry! &amp; thanks! You don't need to use sysdate or today. Here's my solution. It automatically picks up the new variables: data FY_DATA; infile datalines delimiter=',' DSD; input FY01 FY02 FY03; datalines; 100,110,120 ; proc sql noprint; select name,cats("roc_",name) as x into :varnames separated by ' ', :newvarnames separated by ' ' from sashelp.vcolumn where libname ='WORK' and memname = 'FY_DATA' and substr(name,1,2)='FY'; ; quit; %put &amp;varnames; %put &amp;newvarnames; data FY_ROC (drop=I); set FY_DATA; format &amp;newvarnames 4.2; array FY(*) &amp;varnames.; array ROC(*) &amp;newvarnames.; do I= 2 to dim(FY); ROC(I)= (FY(I) - FY(I-1))/FY(I-1); end; run;
I actually got my code to work, bu thanks though!
absolutely not. That is a great introduction but you'll have to gain a lot more knowledge to pass. You can buy the SAS certification prep guide but if you're starting from scratch that will be a steep mountain to climb.
&gt; %put &amp;varnames; &gt; %put &amp;newvarnames; What does that do?
sorry, what do you mean declare your array?
It creates arrays using the macro variables that we just created.
fy(&amp;i+1) is going to resolve as fy(2001+1) and SAS will look for a function called FY() and not a variable called FY2002. To solve this, use another do loop within the loop with another variable: %do i=2001 %to &amp;sysyear; %do j=2002 %to &amp;sysyear; diff&amp;i = (fy&amp;j.-fy&amp;i.)/(fy&amp;j.); %end; %end;
sorry, it should be: %do i=2001 %to &amp;sysyear -1; %let j=%sysfunc(sum(&amp;i,1)); diff&amp;i = (fy&amp;j.-fy&amp;i.)/(fy&amp;j.); %end;
Use numbers to define your array.
That worked! Thank you SO MUCH! Can you please briefly explain what your code does? specifically the %let j=%sysfunc(sum(&amp;i,1)); statement? EDIT: I think I understand what that line did, but my question is, why wouldnt that second do loop work in the first scenario you proposed to do?
I am creating another variable called j which is the calculated sum of the value of &amp;i+1. i.e. I am forcing SAS to calculate the expression before assigning it to the macro variable. If I had written: %let j=&amp;i+1; then the problem would be the variable j would be created as "1+1" and substituted as such in the following code - which will create problems. Insert these options in your code: Options mprint mlogic; Then try the program it both ways. Look at the log. SAS will explain each step of the macro loop and show you how it calculates each variable and each line of code within the macro. Will help you understand how SAS works. Good luck! 
&gt; Options mprint mlogic; wow that is so useful, thank you so much!
If I want to turn off those options, how would I do so?
Options nomprint nomlogic; Or delete the options, save your program, close and re open your session.
Yes! While the image size remains within those limits, the actual graph area (excluding the axis) changes depending on how much space the axis takes...
%let j=%eval(&amp;i.+1); You need this after %do and use &amp;j. . 
Look into proc template for the odd graphics and specify the size of individual graphs. 
You're going to have to be orders of magnitude more specific.
Use %put &lt;macro variable name&gt;= &amp;macro_variable. ; This'll help you debug the issue. 
Without seeing the code, it's hard to say. However, some culprits might be: * You've missed a semicolon somewhere so it's trying to build a massive expression rather than handle some individual lines of code. * You've got a %do loop where for whatever reason you're not reaching the condition to leave it - maybe you're not incrementing your loop variable, maybe you're calling another macro within the loop that is resetting the loop variable somehow (local variables are really useful for avoiding this!) * Maybe you've got some macros calling each other recursively? You can also try taking the code out of the macro functions and manually setting the macro variables to run it and see if it's producing expected results.
OK thanks! I will try it tomorrow!
Ok thanks! I will try it tomorrow.
I've heard the certification course is very difficult and you really have to know your way around SAS to complete it. Granted, i haven't taken it, but i've been through several classes and i still don't think i'd be successful.
I don't know the answer to this, but in general [this page](http://support.sas.com/kb/30/333.html) I've found helpful for trying to find the correct PROC for statistical methods I need when SAS programming.
The very last section of this article may help: https://www.uvm.edu/~dhowell/methods8/Supplements/Testing%20Dependent%20Proportions.pdf 
Sounds like PROC TABULATE to me. Something like: PROC TABULATE MISSING DATA =MyDataSetHere; VAR MyMeasure; CLASS AgeGroup Sex; TABLE AgeGroup Sex AgeGroup*Sex ALL, MyMeasure*MEAN*F=8.2; RUN;
Ah, good thinking! I do have a tendency to try to solve all problems with PROC SQL, so I forget that base SAS has plenty of solutions itself.
Sweet. I guess at this point I'll put it on the back burner until our department gets more money for training.
There are several ways to do this in SAS, I prefer SQL to do it: proc sql; create table table_name as select *, count(1) as column_X, sum(order_value) as column_Y from input_table group by customer_id;quit; edit: sorry for the formatting, i have no idea how to format
Awesome, this worked perfectly, thank you. 
Yes, there's a Date field I can sort
There are some sql options as well, e.g. /* Returns 1 record per age only if there are no ties for max(weight) within each age */ proc sql noprint; create table want as select * from sashelp.class group by age having weight = max(weight) ; quit; /*There is a tie for max age within SEX = F, so we get 2 rows for that group*/ proc sql noprint; create table want as select * from sashelp.class group by sex having age= max(age) ; quit; /* If we don't care which row we take when there's a tie, we can use monotonic() to create an arbitrary tie-break variable which always has distinct values. */ proc sql noprint; create table want(drop = tie_break) as select *, monotonic() as tie_break from sashelp.class group by sex having age= max(age) and tie_break = max(tie_break); ; quit; /* *Generally*, monotonic() behaves the same way as _n_ does in a data step, preserving the row order from when the source table is first read. This example shows how the input dataset is re-ordered by the group by clause. */ proc sql noprint; create table want as select *, monotonic() as tie_break from sashelp.class group by sex ; quit;

Since you're not getting an answer here yet, I've posted your question on [SAS Support Communities, in this topic](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Statistical-Procedures/PROC-MIXED-is-it-possible-to-define-an-effect-as-fixed-if-it-is/m-p/294918). This [article about Fixed vs Random Effects](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/Tip-Fixed-vs-Random-Effects-in-Panel-Data/ta-p/223385) might also help.
Thanks, mate!
numeric variables would not have the leading 0 ever. Also, [at least put a little effort, dude](https://www.google.com/search?q=sas+leading+zeroes&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8#q=sas+leading+zeros)
I love you. Haha! Problem fixed.
No you don't. And no you didn't. It's literally the first result. 
Like I said, I searched and whatever I tried didn't work. Regardless, I don't have to justify my reasons for asking for help. If it annoys you, then I suggest you scroll by posts that ask "lazy" questions. Otherwise, get over yourself dude. Nothing is that deep. Anyways, I'm not going to get into it over someone that is being childish on the internet. Peace.
Your age category is not binary. There are several categories. If 20&lt;= age &lt;=40 then agecat ='20-40';
I assume they meant each category was a binary flag. In which case, they wouldn't be able to separate 35 - 44 in order to make a 20 to 40 category. Essentially, they don't have the raw data to create the variable they need. 
I think this way is not efficient for the different variables that I have..if I understood it correctly.
what does symput do? I never quite understood that even searching it online
call symput creates a macro variable and sets it equal to the value your variable takes on. E.g. dataset has one observation and looks like &gt;var1 var2 var3 &gt;123 456 789 and you say call symput('macrovar',var1); SAS creates a macro variable (&amp;macrovar) and sets it equal to 123 
Ah Ok I get it, thanks!
I'm reading from the commentary, you want to drop every variable which is completely missing over the entire dataset? I think the approach /u/hjqusai suggested should work. I'm really lazy though, so I would probably do that over several steps. I don't have SAS at home, so just throwing out ideas for you. Let's say your dataset is MyData. I further assume you only care about numeric variables. http://pastebin.com/WUAJs6Bg
Do you have very long labels on your columns? If you go to View--&gt;Column Names and check that (with the dataset active) does that reduce the height?
I know it is quite late with the answer, but if it makes sense to improve it still, maybe you can check this: http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrdict/64316/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a000202943.htm The function vname returns the name of the variable in the array. Do i=1 to dim(arr); Call symputx(vname(arr[i]), arr[i]); End; 
[This](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/procstat/63104/HTML/default/viewer.htm#procstat_freq_sect027.htm) page might be helpful. My understanding is that you have to use a proc sort to sort the datasets by the analysis variable, then use a proc freq with the / chisq modifier to actually produce the chi square test. 
Are you sure you need a chi-square test? Based on your description, a treat might be more appropriate. Can you give an example of the data?
I've even been questioning that myself but I'm relatively new to statistics. The staff climate surveys - I actually only have averages of their likert scale scores from each campus (37 campuses). Reading scores - again, I only average scores for each campus. When running descriptive statistics, standard deviation is quite low for each. 
Oops, autocorrect changed ttest to treat. So if your data is 37 averages, I think you are limited in what you can do since you don't have a way to quantify the variability. If there is no way to get the raw data, i.e. the individual surveys and reading scores from each campus, I would suggest graphing the staff climate averages by the reading score averages and see if there is a graphical relationship. Others may have a different idea, but it doesn't seem that Chi square is appropriate.
If I was on my computer I'd share the program I wrote, but I'm very rusty with SAS code after years of using strictly R. Which PROC would the obs argument fall under?
I think they're regular dataset options which can be used in any data or proc step, but again, not at my work computer, so don't take my word for it... My general idea was something like: data1; set sourcedata(firstobs = 1 obs = 2000000); run; data2; set sourcedata(firstobs = 2000001 obs = 4000000); run; etc.
What sort of stuff are you trying to do with this dataset in SAS? What format is the file in now? Depending on the nature of the analysis you're doing, it might not be necessary to load the whole dataset into ram at once. If you're just doing simple data steps, you only need enough memory to load 1 row at a time, or if you use `by` statements you just need enough for 1 by-group at a time. You might also be able to reduce the size of the SAS dataset via the following measures: * Use a length statement to set all variable lengths to the minimum required when importing your dataset. Length 4 is sufficient for most dates. * Recode character variables without many distinct values as integers and map the values using a custom format * Drop any observations and variables you don't need. * Use `by` statements instead of `class`statements wherever possible (may require resorting or indexing).
SAS doesn't load all of the data into ram with most data steps and most procedures. Whenever you submit a data step it is using the processor and reading/writing the data through the hard drive in a temporary work folder and/or the origin/destination folder. Can you speak about the data that you are using? Is it demographic data? Healthcare claims data?
Class statements get you there most of the time, but the more levels you summarise across, the greater the amount of memory you need, and not all procs support a class statement - sometimes a sort or index is unavoidable. E.g. if you have a large dataset of people's transactions and you summarise by gender, a class statement will only need O(1) memory, but summarising by person will need O(n) memory. If you do load your data into RAM, you do indeed have more options - you can use hash objects to merge datasets together without the need for sorting, for instance, and using `sasfile` statements can certainly improve performance. 
The NOSORT option might (or might not) help.
I'm not familiar with how the university works, but if you tell me specifically what you're trying, I'll tell you if it works in the full version.
I never worked with anything related to unix to be honest. I just read that the emulator is running some kind of unix, and the path mentioned at the beginning of the prepguide book for University Edition doesn't look like a windows path (slashes the wrong way around). I'll experiment a bit more later on with this, but I suppose the path needs to be ="/folders/myfolders/excelfile.xls"
If you have some kind of Unix prompt in the emulator, typing "cd" and then enter and then typing "pwd" and enter should return your home directory.
the informat anydtdtm. is your friend.
I think this is exactly what I need. Will try it as soon as I get to the computer with SAS installed. Thx.
Will try and get back to you. Thanks
Will try and get back, thanks. 
This is really helpful. It however outputs the whole table in the same format then default output. Is there a way to access individual data from different tables and assemble a table, E.G.: | MEAN | SEM | P | ... Either way, this is allready helpful. Thx.
I believe OUTER UNION CORR will give you the results you're after. You can use case whens in your SELECT statement to replace missing values with zeros: case when var1= . then 0 else var1 end as var1 Basic approach with a data step: data c (rename = (var1 = xxx var2 = yyy)); set a (drop = var7) b (drop = var7) ; run; Good luck. 
A valid use for `option dkricond`! data example1(drop = var3) example2(drop = var4); array var[7]; output; run; /*By default, if you try to keep variables that aren't present in a dataset, you get an error.*/ /*The following option overrides this behaviour! */ option dkricond = nowarn; proc sql; create table want as select * from example1(keep = var1-var6) outer union corr select * from example2(keep = var1-var6) ; quit; You could get the same result with proc sql; create table want(keep = var1-var6) as select * from example1 outer union corr select * from example2 ; quit; However, this would not perform quite as well, as all the variables you don't want are passed through the select statements.
For 75k rows it probably won't matter, but this approach might not be suitable for really massive tables as it requires O(n) memory.
Yes, good point. Proc freq doesn't work well when a large number of categories are returned.
It sounds like you're wanting a cumulative sum? I have no idea how to do that in SQL, but here's how [someone else solved it](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2120544/how-to-get-cumulative-sum). Alternatively, you can download the transactions into a dataset and create a categorical variable based on the as-of date for each transaction. You could then use proc freq with weight, or use a datastep and retain and first./last. logic to calculate your own cumulative sums. Then you could remerge it with your source data. 
I think this is a good candidate for first. and last. functions of the data step. You can sort your data by account and transaction date. Once you do that, you can use first.account to reset counter variables in a subsequent data step. Variables used for this purpose require the retain commend which means as SAS moves from one row to the next, it will retain its value from the precious row instead of resetting. On my phone but pseudo code would be like Data cumulativesum; Retain runningtotal 0; Set transactiondataset; If first.account then runningtotal=0; Runningtotal=runningtotal+transactionamt; Run; Then for each row/transaction you'll have the running total for that account as of that transaction. Syntax is probably slightly off (especially the retain coommand) but I've done this a ton and it's super easy once you get what it's doing. Good luck! 
I don't know if your excel can do this, but check to see if you have a SAS tab in the ribbons. Easiest way I do it is create a permanent table, then in excel you can either reference that SAS table to create a spreadsheet or, even better, import directly into a pivot table. If it is something you do monthly or regularly.. rerun your program and just hit refresh on your excel file. Boom! Report done. 
Data master(drop=Var7); Length sitename $100 var1-var7 $150; Merge din1(rename=()) Din2(keep=......); By sitename; Run; I hope this works for you. 
I would do it this way as well. Just one slight way to simplify the syntax -- if you code it as "runningtotal + transactionamt;" or "ctr +1;" (without the equal sign part), then you don't need the retain statement, as the variable (runningtotal or ctr) is automatically retained.
This is really useful, thank you. I'll give it a try when I'm able to log back in at work. I knew I should have just asked /r/sas before I wasted time trying to piece it together myself. I've learned a lot from your responses. 
Each site is unique to its dataset, so fortunately I don't have to worry about multiple entries with different populated values. 
can you post a picture of the main dataset you're using?
All the SQL options are O(n^2 ) on CPU / disk, and proc freq is O(n) on memory - a data step is probably the way to go here.
I'll only find out I suppose once I do it, or pay for a test exam. The exam quests in the book do cover some of the things I cannot properly test with the university edition. 
I've hired several SAS contractors in pharma. Typically it's make datasets to a standard (two, actually), make tables, figures, listings, and run some fairly simple analyses as described in a statistical analysis plan. Knowledge of the standards required by the FDA is the hardest part.
Yes, ODS output is your friend here. You can output to PDF, RTF, Excel, HTML, and my personal favorite: LaTeX. Simply surround your proc statements with ods statements like: ods html file="c:\myOutputDirectory\MyHTMLFile.html" style=Journal; proc freq; run; ods html close; If you have a dataset and only want certain columns, simply use proc print wrapped in your ods statement like: ods excel file="c:\myExcelDirectory\MyExcelFile.xlsx" style=Printer; proc print data=work.temp; var ID Variable1 Variable2 Variable9; run; ods excel close;
Your comments are backwards. They should be /\* and \*/ instead of \*/ and /\*. Try fixing those and see if it helps.
As is optional. In order to use a macro variable in Proc SQL I think it needs to be wrapped in quotes.
&gt; In order to use a macro variable in Proc SQL I think it needs to be wrapped in quotes. Definitely not - I use this a lot. This would also apply to your Month() function comparison. I assume that you are passing numbers to the macro without quotes, e.g.: %GetCurrentAsOf(12, 2016); Because quoting those values will cause errors. i.e. %GetCurrentAsOf("12", "2016"); = bad things.
Have you tried resetting the session. Sometimes when I am developing within macros a few missed semicolons can lead to your macro being improperly closed, which can lead to some strange errors, which persist through the session. Someone has already pointed out that your comment syntax looks a little off (it should be fine though because of the ; at the end. So I would also move that section outside of the macro to confirm. 
SAS' university version vs full version follows the same kinda set up as Tableau university vs full version. Basiclly if you download the VM it just opens a browser and you can load csvs, xlsx, txt data just fine and then do all the normal things. University edition restricts the amount of automation that can be done (afaik batch mode is not enabled) and the type of files that can be connected. So basically you can't use university edition to stuff you would normally get paid for by a larger company. Source: used SAS in college, work at a company know that uses SAS and R
Sounds like a homework question. Google 'proc reg plot' first result - https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63033/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_reg_sect017.htm
Yes, however that's not a fair example because there's a semi-colon closing the single line quote '*' which allows the compiler to interpret the incorrect end quote string as a beginning block quote. if you remove the semi-colons like this example data temp1; */ a=1 b=2 /*; c=3; d=4; run; then temp 1 will be created with columns c and d, the proc print will run.
It's hard to say without knowing how FREQUENCY is formatted. Is it always an eight-digit yyyymmdd date? Then you could just do a flat equals comparison after zero-adding the day you want.
Nothing jumps out from what you've written. Do you have keep = or drop = statements somewhere? Does your log mention warnings or errors?
You can use proc means/summary to create a data set with the mean of variable a and then merge the summarized data set back to the original and make the comparison. You can't directly give the numeric variable a value of "Error," but you can set it to missing. You could use proc format to display missing values as "Error." You can also do the summary in proc sql instead.
I don't think this can be done in one step. What you need is the value of the mean. Which you can get with a few methods, e.g. proc means, proc sql, data step. Then you can use this value in another step to get the desired results. I'm not near a machine with SAS, but i'll give an example a go: data _NULL_; set example end=eof; calcfield + B; /*creates a new variable that creates a running total*/ themean = calcfield/_N_; if eof then call symput('themean',themean); /*call symput applies a value to a macro variable, I have called 'themean'*/ run; /*We now have a variable called themean that we can use */ Because we are calculating on a number field putting "error" in there wouldn't really be possible. But we can assign this value to be missing, which may be still be acceptable. data exampleout; set example; if B &gt; &amp;themean. then B = .; run; If the visual impact of error is important to your output I would recommend looking into proc format. Hope this helps. 
Are both ACCT_NUM and CLIENT_ACCT_NUM character variables? I'd assume so. In which case, the easiest method is to convert the account numbers to numerics and then convert it back to character with the leading zeroes removed. I think the code below will work but I'm doing this from memory, so I might be wrong. I use the INPUT function to read in the original account number and convert it to numeric. Then the PUT function to convert it back to character. In both the PUT and INPUT function, you'll have to replace the "N" with the number of bytes your account numbers are. PROC SQL; create table HOME.LEGACY_SOURCE(label="Legacy Source") as select t1.FIELD_1, t1.FIELD_2, t1.FIELD_3, t1.DATE_RANGE, put(input(t1.ACCT_NUM, zN.), N.) as CLIENT_ACCT_NUM from LEGACY_SOURCE t1 where t1.DATE_RANGE between '01jan2016'd and '31jan2016'd order by ACCT_NUM quit; Look up the put, input, and zN. format on the SAS website for additional info. 
Hmm, I've attempted this and received a Syntax Error in SAS EG... ERROR 22-322: Syntax error, expecting one of the following: !, !!, &amp;, *, **, +, ',', -, /, &lt;, &lt;=, &lt;&gt;, =, &gt;, &gt;=, ?, AND, BETWEEN. ERROR 76-322: Syntax error, statement will be ignored. I did add the comma to line you added as well. No joy. :/ But this is exactly what I need -- I only need to remove the zeroes in front of the account number. So this is definitely the right direction... EDIT: So this what it currently looks like: data charvar; input ID$; datalines; 000012345 000054321 ; PROC SQL; create table HOME.LEGACY_SOURCE(label="Legacy Source") as select t1.FIELD_1, t1.FIELD_2, t1.FIELD_3, t1.DATE_RANGE, t1.substr(ACCT_NUM,verify(ID,'0')) as CLIENT_ACCT_NUM from LEGACY_SOURCE t1 where t1.DATE_RANGE between '01jan2016'd and '31jan2016'd order by ACCT_NUM quit; And I'm getting one last ERROR message. It says that "the following columns were not found in the contributing tables: ID." Should I replace the ID with ACCT_NUM or something?
Are the variables character? What error did you get? 
Yeah, it's VARCHAR(14)... As for the error, hold tight, let me put your code in and rerun it. I'll update this post with an edit and the results... Give me a few. EDIT: IT WORKED!!! I must have missed a comma or something the first time I ran it... Gold incoming!!! You're a saint!!!
Glad it worked. I'd still recommend spending some time making sure you understand how it works since you're just starting in SAS. 
Isn't this also what Tranwrd is for? Variable = Tranword (variable,"0",NULL) I'd just use that on the join side so you don't have to change anything, unless that table's going to be joined frequently, in which case I'd either clean up that key or make a bridge table!
You just add a WHERE clause before the GROUP BY clause.
what would be the syntax for where PROD_FAM is not there same Where 'PROD_FAM is not equal to same'
As /u/AuralWanderer said, it would help if you post some info on what is contained in 'frequency' variable. If you can separate out the dates in that variable and make them into dates, then you can compare the dates instead of comparing them using index function, which will help it run on the correct dates.
EDIT: I missed the rest of the duplication checking in the alternative method and confused what defined a duplicate a bit. Hopefully this is now corrected! EDIT2: Damn, typos! Okay, so using SQL, potentially the below: ------- proc sql; title 'Duplicate Rows in DUPLICATES Table'; select **, count( ** ) as count from LNL1 group by PC_PERS_CUST_NUM, PROD_FAMILY having intnx('day',min(APPLICATION_DATE),max(APPLICATION_DATE)) &lt;= 30 ; quit; -------- However it's limited a bit because you can't as easily check row to row the APPLICATION_DATE intervals. I'd probably suggest using a sort and data step as per below. ---------------- /* Sort */ proc sort data=LNL1; by PC_PERS_CUST_NUM, PROD_FAMILY, APPLICATION DATE; run; /* Count */ data LNL1_Duplicates; set LNL1; by PC_PERS_CUST_NUM, PROD_FAMILY, APPLICATION_DATE retain last_PROD_FAMILY last_APPLICATION_DATE count; if first.PC_PERS_CUST_NUM then do; last_PROD_FAMILY = ''; /* I'm assuming this is a character string */ last_APPLICATION_DATE = .; count = .; end; else if intck('day',last_APPLICATION_DATE,APPLICATION_DATE) &lt;= 30 or PROD_FAMILY ne last_PROD_FAMILY then count + 1; last_APPLICATION_DATE = APPLICATION_DATE; run; /* Max */ proc sql; create table results as select **, max(count) as max_count from LNL1_Duplicates group by PC_PERS_CUST_NUM ; title 'Duplicate Rows in DUPLICATES Table'; select * from results (drop=count) ; quit; ----- It's not perfect, and I'm afraid I've not been able to test it as I don't have SAS on this machine, but I hope it at least helps point you in a useful direction. Good luck!
PROC CALIS can't handle non-continuous DVs. Switch to MPlus.
Have you thought of using ID=substr(id,2); This should be able to remove the leading 0. 
That's exactly what I did to solve the issue. Thank you for your response!
Create a new variable equal to that and see what happens. Just put it in a regular data step
What on earth does he need all those layers of functions for? In nearly all cases the output will be just the same as `put(cus1_num, hex8.)`. 
Ah, whoops, missed your last line. T he options are in the users guide
Awesome, thanks a lot. The macro variables were the key, now it works perfectly!
You can use month function to get the month from the date and then use z2.
Thanks, that's a bit cleaner. 
Yup. If your source is a numeric, use the MONTH function, and then PUT it as Z2. 
If you're trying to read in character data, you're going to have to [use the following table](http://www.asciitable.com/) as an index. when you import the file, make sure to specify that you're reading recfm=n, reading in 1 byte at a time, then you're going to have to check for '61'x for a, '62'x for b, etc. So, if you're looking for "a. answer 1", then you're going to have to look for: '61'x followed by '2e'x followed by '20'x followed by '61'x followed by '6e'x followed by '73'x followed by '77'x followed by '65'x followed by '72'x followed by '20'x followed by '31'x Wish there was a better solution, bro. SAS can be a real bitch sometimes.
 please re-read my post. don't ever fucking shit talk my SAS knowledge again. i've been doing SAS for **EIGHT** months. how long have you been on reddit for? 2 weeks? fucking seriously you think you can just throw in those input modulators and semi colons and assume ur right? you are response looksl ike it took 30 seconds to make. my post took FOURTY MINUTES to calculate. i'm not sure where you're are getting the audacity to call me wrong, but frankly it's a little annoying no offense. no offense but im not going to even bother reading your entire post, you post in /r/adviceanimals opinion invalidated. . lol. okay. sorry there is no way i am wrong and your are right. i dont normally do this but downvoted.
he's a manager :P
I've seen version manager and Clearcase used, but never GIT. Version management definitely happens on larger scale projects, but that's not the most common type of SAS use. So even though those were best practices both places I've worked, they were rarely used except for mainline production programs.
&gt; A lot of SAS programmers don't have a background in traditional software dev which might be why source control for SAS devs is hit or miss I'm fairly certain that's the case. I was tempted to bring it up but decided the barrier to entry/learning curve would be too steep to make it worthwhile. 
Try creating a user-defined date format that displays a leading zero. proc format; picture monthtwo (default=2) low-high='%0m'(datatype=date); run; /* test */ data _null_; do date=today() to today()+90; putlog date= date9. date= monthtwo.; end; stop; run; 
Perhaps this helps? https://support.sas.com/software/products/university-edition/faq/SAS_accessdata_Excel.htm
Index is really a great option. It's generally the most direct and simple way to approach free text strings. If you want to get crazy, look into perl operators in sas. The Boon is you can look for both of those words at the same time (I'll post an example later if you would like) 
Have you tried looking through SAS documentation yet? https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63033/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_ttest_sect002.htm If that doesn't help you may want to try asking in SAS Communities https://communities.sas.com/t5/forums/searchpage/tab/message?q=TTest
New_var=max(index('text1',old_var),index('text2',old_var),...);
Add a line like Format $50.; Before the new var command. BTW it looks like the professor wants you to understand nesting commands. 
Thank you
I feel like we shouldn't be doing people's homework. . . Kind of defeats the purpose. 
Were you able to get this resolved? If not, try posting to https://communities.sas.com/ 
I think the best way to do this would be to use the cat and strip functions.
data dummy; do i =1 to 99; output; end; run;
(on mobile so no formatting, soz) I'd trim out the bit that you need and then drop the old and rename the new then merge. There's probably a quicker way to strip it out but assuming the difference is that dataset 1 has the word 'County' after the County name, with a preceding space - Data new; Set old; New_var = reverse(scan(reverse(var) ,1,' '))) Drop var; Rename New_var = var; Run; Then you can merge etc etc
&gt; Q4: Why does sorting in place destroy my index? &gt; A4: Using PROC SORT to sort in-place will physically re-arrange the observations in the data set. Remember that &gt; the index contains RIDs that point to the location of observations in the data set. When the observations are &gt; physically moved, the RIDs in the index become invalid, and all deleted observations are eliminated from the &gt; newly sorted data set. Any indexes that remain after sorting in-place would be unusable because the data set &gt; would no longer match the index. Indexes are not preserved by PROC SORT. &gt; Additionally, the structure of a sorted data set can be changed by using a WHERE expression, the OBS= &gt; option, the DROP= option, or the KEEP= option. Any of these elements can modify the contents of the sorted &gt; data set and, therefore, invalidate any indexes. Similar reasons require that indexes be rebuilt after using &gt; PROC COPY. http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/sugi30/008-30.pdf I hope this answers your question.
In addition to /u/inaniloquent-fish 's solution, there is also the TRANWRD function, which replaces/removes strings from text. new_var=strip(transwrd(var,"county","")); I used STRIP to remove trailing blanks that might be left over. (probably not necessary)
Not at a pc with SAS on it, but I think using both TRANWRD and COMPRESS together might work. First use TRANWRD to strip out the substring (TRANWRD replaces a substring with another substring, so just replace it with a blank), then use COMPRESS to remove all blanks in both strings, and merge on the result. You can read up on TRANWRD here: http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrdict/64316/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a000215027.htm And you can read up on COMPRESS here: http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrdict/64316/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a000212246.htm You could even try to use only compress, but I think it removes the characters individually. Hope this helps!
Another way I just thought of, if the word "County" is at the end of the string everytime, just join on the substring of that variable. So you'll join on something like substr(county_var,1,len(county_var)-6). You'll have to find the SAS equivalents of the functions I used since I'm not sure they are all available, but test and see.
Not by itself. It can help beef up an application or a career history though.
What does the double reverse function do in this situation?
Ah this one seems more straight forward, thanks!
Ok I can give this a go, thanks!
Ok thanks for the help!
Thanks for the reply!
Ah ok that makes more sense-thanks!
Another person on a cell phone here. I'm thinking you should read the SAS dictionary.Columns table and get a list of all the county variables then try and make a field with that County name then just match away. 
[Edit: markdown was hiding some parentheses] I like using regex for stuff like this, because I hate counting characters... Not at a SAS computer, so my code may not work. county = prxchange("s/\^\(.+\)\bcounty\s*$/$1/io", -1, county); Essentially: * Swap command: s/ * String begins with a bunch of characters: \^\(.+\) * There is a word boundary (space, punctuation, etc): \b * You encounter "county" and possibly blank spaces to end the string: county\s*$ * Return the bunch of stuff at the start: $1 I've been reading this sub for a month and it's weird that I haven't seen more regex. This is definitely more involved in that you have to understand regex instead of the basic functions such as substr and index, but regex is so powerful it's useful to learn if you're going to do any sort of string manipulation. 
It might give you a slight edge but may be very trivial compared to other qualifications necessary to be successful at an interview. I completed base and preparing advanced cos I felt it is an opportunity to learn new/unknown techniques about sas. Let me know if you need any help. Good luck..
It might help you get interviews. It will help you with understanding a lot of the basics. But you would have to use real world experience in your interview since you will not get preferential treatment in any way.
Yes! I would recommend doing advance as well. It'll show that you don't have to be taught the language. 
Oh my gosh I knew it should have been super obvious. I blame not being able to make coffee because the lead levels in our water are apparently too high loll (or maybe I should blame it on the lead). thank you!
I was doing it right it just wasn't working
I don't know I submitted the code and my teacher counted it as right
If you never got it to work in SAS how do you know it is right?
I agree with /u/fuuoldself, our team has interviewed 3 candidates over the last year for analyst roles that had the certification and NO actual SAS experience. Through the interview process with our technical lead it was very apparent they did not know SAS code and when we pressed them on this, they said they passed the exam so they could put in on their resume. On the flip-side once you have experience it can help with future job opportunities/promotions/raises/etc.
So, they didn't know anything at all or knew some code? What I am getting at, is I will do base SAS certification, that however doesn't teach me Macros, but will I be expected to know that for an interview?
I work in F.S. and a lot of my work is rolling up transactional level data to the customer, or employee level. It might help if you give a bit more detail about how your data is structured and what the end result of your analysis is.
Yeah that was the one thing that resonated with me. As an analyst, data scientist, statistician etc you want some freedom and flexibility not locked down applications. One thing they did mention in regards to R is that their new cloud analytics platform Viya is going to have API's for Java and Python with support for R coming shortly. If you ask me though, its probably just a way to get current R users to use SAS until they depend on it.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I3wqXiASYGQBElrZg-Tj4zpsDceVfQjJ_cPUxGaAx2E/edit?usp=sharing Maybe this will help?
yeah, the summary dataset created for var_a would contain a single row for every value of var_a. You can summarize other variables in addition to balance by adding them to the var statement.
i checked out http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/forum2008/135-2008.pdf and it looks like people w/ SQL Server people don't use mode at all. The Mode= if I recall correctly (havent been behind a teradata server in awhile) option makes very slight changes, I think it deals with stuff with case-sensitive/insensitive stuff. Long story short, ignore it mode=. 
Okay, thanks for the advice, I'm going to try a couple things and see how it goes!
Thanks, im sure sugi sas will help on the job too because, lets face it, when you are beginner google is your best friend.
Man, it's amazing what you can find online. A lot of people have really bad experiences learning SAS in a class room. I hit the jack pot when I found Mike Zdeb's PDFs from the class he teaches. Another great one is Charles DiMaggio. Both Epidemiologist. 
4 years into using sas professionally, google is still best friend.
It seems that the easiest way for you to do this is to just use proc means/summary (I don't use proc summary) with the "class" statement in order to collapse the data into groups. Going off the variables in the mock data: proc means data=mock_data noprint nway missing ; class score_band ; output out=output1 (drop=_type_ rename=(_freq_=count_in_group)) sum(balance)=total_balance ; run ; You would repeat this for each group you're collapsing by. This is pretty standard SAS code for collapsing a dataset to get summary statistics. There are many other ways to do this, most common would be using SQL. Here's a paper with a bit more information on what is going on here: http://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings10/026-2010.pdf 
Won't that give me a simple summary rather than a summary over unique accounts?
There is this app if you guys are running Visual Analytics https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sas.android.bimobile&amp;hl=en There is also SASBIWS - you can write a stored proc that has html output and use your phone to browse to it 
So after merging I would have another data step where I did the calculation?
The means procedure would calculate your stats...from there you'd merge against your original data set and do your calculations once merged. So: proc summary.... proc means... Proc sql;create table output as select t1.*, t2.* from original as t1 left join meansoutput as t2 on t1.commonvar=t2.commonvar; Quit; 
You can try proc SQL and not do a group by which will do two steps automatically (there will be a note about remerging summary statistics in a log). Not sure if this is going to work. I know it works when 'group by' is different than what you have in select clause (means having less variables in 'group by'). Proc SQL; Select a, avg(a) as newvar, a - calculated newvar; Quit; 
My idea for a sql proc was something like: SELECT k.A-j.avg from (SELECT avg(A) as avg from data1) as j cross join (SELECT A from data1) as k I don't know that there is a built in median function in the sql compiler for sas, the tsql code for median is pretty tedious. 
SUM will exclude missing values. However the sum function here is resolving: SUM(200+.) which is equal to: SUM(.) Which is equal to missing. It's definitely a bit of a trick question, but just remember with functions you are applying the function to what is inside the brackets. so if it was: SUM(200,.) That would be equal to 200. 
let me guess...were they from India? they tend to treat SAS certification like microsoft certifications. They take these 2 week prep courses for the exam, then pass it, then try to get a SAS programming job. I see it all the time. Experience is everything, certifications dont mean much on their own.
Amount+additionalamount=missing. Sum(missing)=missing Missing+200=missing
If you've a Remote Desktop/virtual desktop link, you can use it in chrome. 
The simplest way is probably via a single sql re-merge, where you compare the value of the measure to the median of the measure: /* generate some test data */ data somedata; do i = 1 to 20; measure=int(rand('NORMAL',5,2)); output; drop i; end; stop; run; /* sql remerge */ proc sql; create table pure_sql_method as select measure, measure-median(measure) as difference_from_median from somedata; quit; I have a few more techniques if this isn't suitable.
This is a great example of a trick question on this test. This is just an excuse for you to buy their test prep materials. You'd normally read the syntax on the web, and do sum (var,var2,etc) and be fine, but they want you to not only have syntax memorized (and yes, the sum function is a bad example since it's so common and you SHOULD have the syntax memorized), but spot these very unlikely coding errors. There are other questions where the best thing to do would be one proc, but a mostly equivalent proc will be the right answer, because the better use proc has a missing semicolon or parantheses. It's a very poor test, and a terrible judge of whether or not you're a good programmer, but sadly it's still a nice feather to have in your cap. Just make sure you get the prep book for advanced too if you take that test.
SAS studio lets you do this to an extent, but it isn't particularly usable on a mobile - you really need a proper keyboard and a large monitor for this sort of thing.
1. Produce dataset of residuals from regression 2. Produce boxplot from dataset produced in step 1. I presume your problem is with step 1?
Does it automatically get saved to the VM? If no then no :( There is a VM folder on my computer, not sure if it's the old one or the new one though
Any tips on getting experience (paid or non-paid) or different exercises/tasks to complete on sample data sets? I just passed the base certification and am worried about this exact issue. I'm going to contact a recruiter for a temp position on Monday, but am unsure how many positions will be available with no previous experience &amp; just the base certification. I'm prepping for the advanced cert, but think some real world tasks/experience would be helpful for interviews like this. Thanks! @ OP: I just passed the exam on Friday, so PM if you have any questions about prepping for the exam!
Personally, I hate SAS graphics and think they are quite poor when compared to R's graphics. I like to create my model in r and save my residuals and then send the residuals to R via proc iml and have SAS send the R boxplot commands to R to run the graphic and return it to SAS. If this is something you'd like to do, let me know and I'll throw up an example. 
Your example might be a little too simplified for what you actually mean; for example %let myvar=HOLY COW(; %put &amp;myvar.; does work properly. I'm assuming you're trying to reference this macro variable somewhere else (like in a %macro) and the quoting is a problem. In simple situations, you can try putting the passed value in double quotes, then dequote it, like this: %let myvar=HOLY COW(; %put &amp;myvar.; %macro testcow(x); %let y=%sysfunc(dequote(&amp;x.)); %put &amp;y.; %mend; %testcow("&amp;myvar."); This solution will not work for any arbitrary string, but may be adequate for what you need. If all else fails, you can always use the %SUPERQ function to make sure *nothing* gets evaluated; for example, this works: %let myvar=HOLY COW(; %put &amp;myvar.; %macro testcow(x); %put %superq(x); %mend; %testcow(%superq(myvar)); Note you don't put an ampersand when referencing the variable with %superq.
&gt; %let myvar=HOLY COW(; &gt; %put &amp;myvar.; &gt; &gt; %macro testcow(x); &gt; %let y=%sysfunc(dequote(&amp;x.)); &gt; %put &amp;y.; &gt; %mend; &gt; %testcow("&amp;myvar."); You're a God. I'll keep you posted regarding this. Thank you very much!
hello. the special characters % and ; is not working for this code. some strings has that symbol.
I don't have my old autoexec file anymore because at my new job we have Enterprise Guide, but you can do this with DM statements that are auto run. You're looking for DM 'results' winclose, 'wpgm' I believe. Something along those lines. Basically get it working, and then stick it in your autoexec file so it runs on startup. 
You will have to create your own format for monthname to numeric (no such informat exists in SAS).. After you convert it to numeric, you can use it with MDY function to make it a SAS date.
Ahh okay, didn't think about creating my own format.
I have it down to jan16 for example. I'm very new to sas, how does the INPUT function work?
I think this is probably what you were trying to do: PROC SQL ; create table Race ( Race char(32), Number num(4), Percent num(4), Cumulative_Percent num(4) ); insert into Race values ('Non-Hispanic Whites', 1471, 65.9, 65.9) values ('Non-Hispanic Blacks', 376, 16.9, 82.8) values ('Hispanics', 218, 9.8, 92.6) values ('Other', 166, 7.4, 100) ; title 'Race'; select * from Race; quit; Quite a few fixes: * Don't surround numeric values with quotes - you only need those for character values * Make sure all column names are valid SAS variable names * Add a closing `)` to your create table statement * Increase the length of your Race variable to accommodate the length of the specified values I generally prefer to use a data step for this sort of thing - the syntax is more flexible, e.g.: data race2; infile cards dsd; input Race :$32. Number Percent Cumulate_Percent; cards; 'Non-Hispanic Whites',1471,65.9,65.9 'Non-Hispanic Blacks',376,16.9,82.8 'Hispanics',218,9.8,92.6 'Other',166,7.4,100 ; run; 
Oh so technically, would it be a "good" thing then?
SAS is really wizard based, which means a lot of point-and-click stuff. I think there are a lot of people scared of "code" and syntax issues, which SAS handles. SAS is also good at selling "solutions," which has an appeal. I've worked with teams that paid SAS for their fraud framework simply because they knew it was a tool designed specifically for their purpose. They could have totally made other open-source tools do the same thing, but isn't this the same reason people pay consultants untold amounts of money? Funny enough, SAS is a the cheaper option when compared to a contractor. 
Libraries, validation, academic respect, industry demand, prior learning, prior investment / legacy code.
Large institutions (healthcare, finance, government), need the support and reliability that comes from working with an established vendor and not open-source freeware.. and if something goes wrong, they need somebody they can sue.
It's the industry standard. You can't even FdA approve things unlwss it's analyzed in SAS.
At my workplace we've always stayed clear of the wizards and just written our own code - to each their own I suppose.
legacy bullshit, that is all
FDA doesn't insist on SAS. You can submit your results any way you like as long as it's reproducible. 
From what I remember, the only FDA requirement is that it needs to be from a validated system and the FDA has confirmed that R is. However datasets must be submitted in XPT (SAS Transport Files) which is open now but causes confusion because of the link with SAS still. 
Why SAS then? 
Only from a familiarity standpoint and the fact that all of my code from the past is in SAS, and would probably be a pain to convert.
SAS does enable users to write code, even if sales reps (who generally know absolutely nothing about SAS) would rather they didn't. Even given the sales pitch, I'm shocked that they have customers who apparently don't know that SAS code is a thing.
Coalesce(col1,col2,col3)
Do you use a solution like McAfee for anti-virus at your client installations, or do you use AVG? Hopefully that answers your question.
Does this work? proc sort data=data1; by member_id; proc sort data=data2; by member_id; proc sort data=data3; by member_id; proc sort data=data4; by member_id; proc sort data=data5; by member_id; data new; merge data1 data2 data3 data4 data5; by member_id; run; If not, I'm not sure what you're asking, exactly. 
Kinda. The 'rate', has the same name throughout the different data sets. I just realized this so I ended up renaming the rates variable within each dataset and did the merge statement as suggested. Thanks though! 
That works! Alternately you can use a `set` statement to set them all together and then use `proc transpose`.
You want to ruin an R user's day: Go to their .rprofile file and add: `+` &lt;- function(x, y) { return(x * y) } &gt; 7 + 3 [1] 21 Try doing something like that in SAS. 
Depending on how you define 'good', yes. 
But why?
The connectivity with legacy mainframe systems is also a plus.
Honestly not far from the truth. There are few reasons for any organisation to start using SAS these days if they've got this far without it - at a bare minimum, one should consider WPS. One possible exception would be if you were a supplier and your customer required compatibility with a very specific feature within SAS, but that too is really just legacy by extension.
Yeah, one of the new JVM languages (Kotlin) is specifically advertised with this as a feature.
In terms of using it I would challenge that SAS has one of the most robust offerings in suites out there from Data Integration view point and native connectivity to data sources etc. You mentioned difficulty in installing. We have our installations scripted along with license mgmt. Installation of clients is now even easier with the change that you can do stand alone install of clients and the clients now manage updates directly through SAS. 
There is no appeal to SAS as a single user. I can't see anyone ever getting into SAS out of their own pocket (barring the educational edition they have). I just can't see that happening. I use R at home on my desktop. I've used SAS at work for years. We use it at work because all of the programmers know it, have it installed and paid for, and getting data out of SAS is problematic in and of itself.
I have to agree a coalesce function is what comes first to mind
if you are code savy you could write an app against the SAS Integration Technologies Check this solution out https://boemskats.com/build-apps-with-sas/
I would develop some example projects. Perhaps something that you may personally need. You can always show up with your code and explain what you have developed and why you did it a certain way.
Perfect, thanks. For anyone else trying to do this, if you are trying to do the same but with text instead you can used coalescec() instead of coalesce().
oh my god
This paper may give you some insight http://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings16/10721-2016.pdf
Same here. I've been using SAS for over 30 years and have never bothered with the wizards.
`proc sql` only accepts input in a very specific format, i.e. written up as values statements. With a data step, you can write your own logic to parse pretty much any imaginable file directly, even data saved in binary format rather than as plain text. For example, with the data step, you would be able to read in a csv file directly, but using only proc sql, you would have to type out each line of the file as a separate values statement.
Won't that tend to result in A^3 (can't find a subscript) being used to model Y^1 and Y^2?
Sorry, I misunderstood this morning. I thought you meant you wanted Y1 = A1 + B0, Y2 = A2 + B1, Y3 = A3 + B2, etc. So the B term was what was lagged. What you want is for the Y2 = A1 + B1 + A2 + B2, etc. So it's cumulative. I'm not sure there is an easy way to do that. 
Do you by chance have access to SAS Enterprise Guide? There is a logistic regression wizard-driven task that avoids the coding (my preference). If not, you could try the SAS University Edition - free version of SAS through SAS Studio (web version of Base SAS/EG) that has the wizard driven tasks there as well. http://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html Unfortunately I'm no good with code, so I can't help you there. But thought I'd give you an alternative :)
Thank you very much.
You need to initialize your original dataset. Option 1: data dout; set dset1-dset20; Run; Option 2: Data dout; Set dset1; Run; %do I= 2 %to 20; Data dout; Set dout dset&amp;i. ; Run; %end; 
Replace: %do k=12 %to 13; data stacked; set descrip&amp;k; run; %end; With: %do k=12 %to 13; Proc append base=stacked data=descrip&amp;k; run; %end; Proc append will concatenate datasets, but will also initialize the base dataset the first time if it doesn't exist.
Right, but if I run the code multiple times, wouldnt it continue to append?
I will give this a try thanks.
I'm inclined to say it's a weird printer/device setting. I found [this](http://support.sas.com/kb/32/474.html) which suggests using the PNG300 driver when using ODS RTF. goptions reset=goptions device=png300; ODS . . . 
So I should have : PROC PRINTTO LOG="c:\...\hw8.log" PRINT="c:\...\hw8.lst new; RUN; at the beginning of it after setting the library, and it should be good to go? I know I don't need the "work.", nor do I need to use caps for SAS keywords and libraries. I do it because it makes me think about whether the dataset is permanent or temporary and avoids obvious errors since I am just learning SAS. 
Also thanks a lot
Oh, ok. Yeah that works. Good luck. 
Thank you. Output was exactly what I was looking for. Hard to believe I overlooked something so simple!
What do you mean 'it didn't work'? In order for anyone to be able to help you, you will need to post an example of the code you tried and the input datasets you used. For best results, post all of this as text, not as pictures of text. Your method should be ok, but watch out for instances where one or more of the `by` variables are missing, or where there are slight differences between spelling / case / whitespace, or where you have duplicate rows.
If I put the drop/keep in the data step, would it ensure proper sorting?
Depending on what exactly the variable input is that makes it conditional, you could just make the macro conditional. For example: %macro summary; %IF *variable1* = 1 %THEN %DO; proc summary; by *summary_var*; var *variable1*; output out=*output1*; run; %END; %else %if *variable2* = *2* %THEN %DO; ...... %END; %mend summary; *call the macro; %summary; edit - The "......" represents a new proc summary. You can continue this "if then do" loop for as many as you need, and then if need to append together, you can add a data step append by setting them all together, if needed.
You will have to create macro variables from your data set variables before the check.
Ah that makes sense, thanks!
The function CALL SYMPUT lets you output data to a macro variable (and similarly CALL SYMGET lets you retrieve a macro variables). If you're using PROC SQL you can also use the INTO keyword to set a macro variable's value.
Taking .sas7bdat directly. As in if you have no SAS and someone sends you a transfer in .xpt files, you're more or less screwed.
well duh. that's a user problem, not a shortcoming of SAS. The SAS user sending you the data could easily send you that data in a different format. there used to be a utility that would read a SAS dataset and let you save it as something else...can't recall what it's called though.
sounds like you're offering services you cant provide, which is your problem, not a limitation of SAS. Sounds like you got in over your head.
We have SAS. I use SAS every day. I literally say that in this thread. I answered the question posed by OP based on my observations of SAS for the years I've been using it. I never said it's a limitation of SAS. If anything it's a built in stranglehold on the industries that use it. Perfectly implemented. There is no appeal to single users for personal use. It is very hard to break out of use in large industry. This is why people still use SAS. 
People still use SAS because it is the best at what it does. Hands down. As far as I know, SAS is not intended for personal use. Are you trying to do your taxes with it or something? Maybe look into Excel or Quicken.
The 'file structure" of a SAS dataset is designed to be used by SAS only. It is not intended to be a method of delivery, although you can do that if the end user has SAS. SAS can easily output data in open source formats, as well as open source relational database tables. Just because Covance or whatever CRO you're working with doesnt want to convert the data they send you, doesnt mean SAS is "anti open source", or has any limitation whatsoever. 
this is so false. SAS is so much more than a statistical analysis tool.
clearly you are inexperienced with SAS.
there is no complete competitor for everything SAS does. 
Have you tried PROC SQL? E.g. PROC SQL; CREATE TABLE summary AS SELECT year, month, MIN(Number) AS Min_Number, MAX(Number) AS Max_Number FROM MyDataSet GROUP BY year, month; QUIT; To do the same with a data step and BY statement you could do: DATA summary (DROP = Number); SET MyDataSet; BY Year Month; LENGTH Min_Number Max_Number 8; RETAIN Min_Number; IF FIRST.Month THEN Min_Number = Number; IF LAST.Month THEN DO; Max_Number = Number; OUTPUT; END; RUN;
Thank you so much!
apparently the only SAS products you are aware of are EG and EMiner, and there are many, many more. Your post title says "Why do people still use SAS"?...which is a dumb question, but expected given your minimal experience level, and understanding of the wide array of tasks SAS is used for. EG is a Windows front end, but it connects to a SAS Metadata Server that can run on Linux....unless your installation is extremely basic. When you refer to "SAS" you are referring to many more products than just EG/EMiner. I dont think anyone could possibly know less about SAS than you. Sorry you're having such a hard time with basic installations. Maybe you should get a job with the Geek Squad, or the Genius Bar.
Im not well versed in sql. Do you have a sample code by chance?
You're a bit off topic. He made a point about SAS having good GUIs, and I merely pointed out that the two best competing products are far better than what SAS has to offer. Neither RStudio nor PyCharm are "statistical analysis tools".
Thanks! I tried using the innate count in freq but SAS fails on the first proc freq by id*drug cause I have over a million records and I guess it's too much for my computer to handle and crashes it. 
and you are wrong, and are clearly inexperienced with what SAS has to offer.
&gt; OSX is a pretty widespread development environment in the software and data science communities SAS is not used for software development, and OSX is not widely used in data science. I never said All SAS products are cross platform, but that doesnt matter because you aren't familiar with all SAS products, and you aren't very familiar with SAS in general given your 3 weeks of experience in academia only. SAS is actually selling more and more cloud based hosted environment licenses these days, and in that case you can use any computer you want. I had one contract where we were allowed to "bring your own equipment", and I was able to use remote desktop on my MacBook Pro to use SAS. SAS is mainly used in very large client/server environments, not tiny little academic environments. 
 &gt; Neither RStudio nor PyCharm are "statistical analysis tools". RStudio https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RStudio 
Yes, u/conmanau has a good solution. If you can go back and rehash your original data, that would be ideal. In the future, you can create your own encryption keys using probably 40 or so bytes (26 letters + 10 digits + some special characters). I would make the same number of keys, all with the characters in different sequences, as you have characters. Then choose which key to use based on the character in a particular position. Then substitute the character in the appropriate key for the original character. You can then write your own code to reverse it. Just be sure to test the decryption code before you get rid of the original data.
&gt; e program formatted text, by the way, is made by adding 4 blank sp This seems like an inefficient way because I have to specify patients and drug type. 
designed for statistical analysis....
It sounds as though you want to fit a simple linear model. Rather than reinventing the wheel, I suggest you look into the tools available within SAS for doing this. `proc reg` would be a good start.
SAS Programmer here. Depends on where you are in your career and what industry you want to work in. SAS is big in large banking firms and data mining agencies. If you have no prior programming experience, then if you want to learn SAS, you can access the free training that SAS provides on their website. When I first started programming in SAS, the free training really helped me out with learning the syntax. The fact that you know SQL already gives you an advantage and the only thing you need is programming experience/certification.
There are a couple issues with your query.... First off are you trying to import variables from a file? If first name and last name are already on the file then you need to replace input with a length statement. So instead of: input firstname $9. lastname $9 you would do this: length firstname $9 lastname $9; The length statement determines the length of a variable when SAS encounters it. If you don't use a length statement, then SAS will automatically set the length of the variable from the first value of the variable(example if firstname='BOB' then the length would be 3 since BOB has 3 characters in it). Second are you trying to write information to the log or to a variable? PUT is used to convert values from numeric to character and %PUT will write statements to the log. If you are trying to assign values to variables then I would suggest you remove the PUT s that are in your code like this: if firstname='Saly' then firstname=' '; if lastname='Simth' OR lastname='Hernadnez' then lastname=' '; so when you put this all together: data invalidcheck; set work.import; length firstname $9 lastname $9; if firstname='Saly' then firstname=' '; if lastname='Simth' OR lastname='Hernadnez' then lastname=' '; run; 
I thought the whole point of the proc was that it attempted to produce the best fitting model - i.e. the linear combination of parameters that maximises the explained variance. No need for any macro shenanigans.
My understanding is that idkwtfhell (was that username created after last night?) is looking to have a Bobby Flay throw down to see which combination of weights applied to the predictors can result in a model with the best fit provides; this is different than finding the best fitting model based on the (unweighted) predictors. If the former, Return of the Macro Shenanigans! 
I work at a large bank, SAS is heavily used by our Credit Risk teams, Modelling teams, analytics &amp; reporting functions. If you already know SQL i don't think it will be hard to pick up, and i personally use a lot of SQL within SAS when extracting &amp; joining data sets together or even putting together summaries. From my understanding, Banking/Finance/Insurance are the main users of SAS.
Wait - I'm confused too. I suggested a solution that would record and compare the r-squareds from a bunch of competing models where the data are weighted differently: a = b c d; a = .10b .40c .50d; a = .20b .30c .50d; a = .30b .20c .50d; etc... But these weights will have no effect on the r-squared. My new response is: idkwtfhell 
If you mean you want to do a logistic regression with repeated measures, you want Proc Glimmix.
OK thanks! I know in proc mixed and genmod that you have the repeated statement option and specify the type of covariance. How does glimmix differ as I know it doesnt have the repeated statement available. 
If a random statement is not used, is the estimate produced still an OR?
I believe the issue here is that the `like` operator is only valid in `proc sql`, not in other procs or data steps. Use the `find` or `index` functions to get a similar result.
Thanks! I'm pretty excited about it. I'm not sure about the exact configuration but the front end is normal html, css, and js that runs on a SAS web server, which handles all the url routing and requests. The SAS web server can trigger SAS stored processes so that's where all the data manipulation code lives. The SAS web platform gives analysts like me a central place to put shared tools and reports so it's pretty handy. 
Thanks for the reply! Sounds like this might be more of a lift than I thought. Do you know of any good docs I should check out? 
Can't recommend, as I've successfully avoided using/selling SPDS :-) But...you might want to check out also using SPDE (scalable performance data engine) that's included in SAS Base. For a user/developer it's almost same thing as SAS base library, just few options more in libname. Technically, the storage format is different. But much less setup than SPDS.
Is the DB normalised? Do you need all of the text columns, and could any of them be replaced with numeric ones? This could give you quite a significant performance boost in extreme cases, e.g. where you have a relatively small number of distinct values in a text column that's hundreds of characters wide.
Thanks. What I'm looking for though is something that automatically pulls and test all words from the keywords table as it can be over 50 words long. 
Check http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrcon/68089/HTML/default/viewer.htm#p1f92kngyuurnln120e2na45022k.htm Or If number of keywords is small, you can load them as macrovars and loop over them extracting the value with symget()
Thanks, I'll defintely check that out! 
This looks really close to what I need, thanks for responding. ~~I apologize if this is basic, still getting used to sas, but sas is saying that word as a variable is uninitialized, where can I define that? Thanks!~~ EDIT: I figured out what that meant, however it seems like this code is only reading 2 rows from my testing table? Any way to fix this?
Thank you very much. I am just starting this process and appreciate your level of detail. 
Sorry, forgot to include the `end = eof` part on the set statement that reads in the lookup table. Without that the data step terminates on the second iteration after already getting to the last row of the lookup dataset during the first iteration.
Thanks so much for your help, I appreciate it! 
Thanks! I'll be adding a lot of rows every month so I'm probably stuck with standard indexes. 
For converting to R, it might be easiest to do this in R with the haven package. Go into R, install haven (install.packages("haven")), and then read in your SAS dataset (new_dataset &lt;- haven::read_sas("path/to/old_dataset.sas7bdat"). Then save the R dataset.
You could do the whole thing in R, but if you just want to convert the SAS files to R files, you could do parts of it in SAS, then open R, read the SAS dataset into R, and carry on with whatever it is you want to do in R.
To me it sounds like you would use RODBC to connect to the SQL server, then grab your data. The creation of the .sas7bdat files I imagine could be any file format (maybe try binary files if you need fast read times). Then maybe using lubridate you could create your calendar format. Not sure what regression you are using, but google (regression type) in R and I'm sure you will be all good to go.
I'm so sorry, I misunderstood and thought you had done this in SAS and now some external partner wanted you to hand off an R dataset to them.
If you haven't already, I suggested posting to r/rstats, or even askstatistics.
You could use SQL to create a table of households that have bought brand A, then filter the original dataset to just those households 
Proc transpose data=din out=dout; By household; Id brand; Var date; Run; 
I've seen it take up to 4 hours. Hope it worked out
I think the difference is you're looking at a pooled logistic model without and looking longitudinally with the random statement, consequently making assumptions about covariance structure.
Ooooh I'll try this!! Thank you. 
If I'm understanding the requirement correctly, using first./last. logic in this case causes unnecessary complicated thinking. If you group by control, date, test and calculate the minimum of result_determination, a minimum of 0 would indicate the grouping had a positive result. You can accomplish this using proc summary or proc sql; whichever is easier for you.
Thanks! Worked!
Make macro variables available in other sessions 
Agreed, I have used it for this reason before. To OP: You can create a macrovariable in your session with %LET, but if you use %LET within a macro, then the value will only exist within the macro. Initialising the variable with %GLOBAL prevents the macro from deleting the value after it is executed. Example: %MACRO some_macro(parameter); %GLOBAL variable_thing; %LET variable_thing = &amp;parameter. ; %MEND some_macro; %some_macro(parameter = 36); PUT &amp;parameter. ; This PUT statement should now send 36 to the log. 
\* %PUT &amp;variable_thing. ;
Seems easy enough. When I build an advanced expression using the computed columns, I cannot get the expression to validate. The prompt name (from prompt manager) is 'AGING'. So for the expression I tried =AGING and =&amp;prompt_AGING but I get syntax errors. What am I missing?
Try it without = Edit: just &amp;aging
if you want to keep your data as a number variable. You should also be able to use Options missing = '0'; See SAS documentation for more info: [MISSING= System Option](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrdict/64316/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a000227574.htm)
Cheers!
So do I put anything I want in the %let statement or is the var=variable and =value have to have specific reference?
The code: %let blah=TEXT; creates a macro variable called blah, with the content *TEXT*. Then, whenever you put the reference: &amp;blah in your code, SAS will replace it with its contents, in this case *TEXT*. Which is not particularly helpful unless you want your code to contain the word *TEXT* all the way through it. However, by using %let var=variable = value; then now the macro variable var contains the text *variable = value*. If you then put &amp;var into your code, as /u/GooseTheGeek does, it gets replaced by variable = value and SAS will then run that as code. Notice how in /u/GooseTheGeek's code, he adds the semicolon after &amp;var, because the value of &amp;var doesn't include the necessary semicolon itself. This is deliberate, because sometimes you don't want it there. In your case, the suggestion is that if you have a big block of code written in IF-THEN-ELSE stuff, you store that as a macro variable with the same method (so write %let ifblock = IF (thing) THEN thing ELSE thing; etc), then in the data step just reference the macro variable using &amp;ifblock; If there are semicolons in your block of code, you need to "hide" them like this: %str(;). That way they won't end the %let statement, but when you reference the variable later they'll show up and get run properly.
I've had to read macro code with lines that were more than 60% ampersand. You get to that point, you start seeing the matrix.
The method listed [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sas/comments/5e51v7/automatically_rerun_lines/daa722g/). Lets you write the code once and apply it to multiple datasets without cut and paste. You write it once in the %Macro Statement. That macro takes 4 inputs, the library and dataset of the output and set datasets. Then you call the macro by using the %testmacro(targetlib,targetds,setlib,setds). In your example it would be %testmacro(work,stuff,work,junk). but you could just change stuff and junk for other data sets. The data step doesn't run until you run %testmacro. UCLA has a nice intro macro course [here](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/sas/seminars/sas_macros_introduction/). If you don't want to run the %macro statement each time you want to run the macro you'll need to research how [macro catalogues](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/mcrolref/61885/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a001328775.htm) work. 
Thanks, I that is my current approach, but I found a more efficient way at the end.
I think the easiest to define it is that SAS data sets contain data files that can be stored in a library and contain values that can be organized by a table. SAS data files are a kind of data set that contain descriptor information about the data, that SAS data set may not have. 
As far as I know, and I work for SAS, that unfortunately does not exist. CTRL-F is probably your best bet.
Maybe, ctags + some editor with it's support would be a ~~solution~~ workaround (but I couldn't find any SAS tag generating tool.) I guess I'll need to do implement something myself.
I like to use the Atom editor and the SAS Language plugin to maintain my code base
Search for array. The pseudo code would go something like Array rnd &amp;_rnd; Data new; Set henry; For i in rnd Do; I = max(0,min(i,3)); End; Sorry for the bad formatting. Am on the phone.
Here's half a solution, you'll have to build a macro *processVar* which takes a varname as a string, look at the rightmost 4 chars of the varname to decide if to process. %MACRO ParseAllVariables (thisTable); %LOCAL ldsid lthisvar; %let ldsid=%sysfunc(open(&amp;thisTable,i)); %do i=1 %to %sysfunc(attrn(&amp;ldsid,nvars)); %let lthisvar = %sysfunc(varname(&amp;ldsid,&amp;i)); %PUT RANGEVAR :: &amp;thisTable &amp;lthisvar; %processVar(&amp;lthisvar); %end; %let rc=%sysfunc(close(&amp;ldsid.)); %MEND; 
Assuming your values are numeric and you have some kind of patient identifier and original data is in a wide format: /****SET UP FAKE DATA -- NOT MY MACRO, STOLE IT, FORGET SOURCE****/ %macro RandBetween(min, max); (&amp;min + floor((1+&amp;max-&amp;min)*rand("uniform"))) %mend; data henry(drop=i); do i = 1 to 10; var1_rd = %randbetween(1,5); var2_rd = %randbetween(1,5); var3_rd = %randbetween(1,5); name = catt("henry", i); output; end; run; /****MELT DATA****/ data nar_henry(keep= pt origval origvarnm); set henry; array rd {*} _numeric_; do i = 1 to dim(rd); pt = name; origval = rd{i}; origvarnm = vname(rd{i}); output; end; run; /****FIX YOUR VALUES -- if more limiters are to be set, use a proc format to make a table format****/ data fixed_vals; set nar_henry; if origval &gt; 3 then finalval = 3; else if origval &lt; 1 then finalval = 1; else finalval = origval; drop origval; run; /*PUT IT BACK TOGETHER*/ proc sort data = fixed_vals; by pt; run; proc transpose data=fixed_vals out= newdata(drop=_name_); by pt; id origvarnm; run;
Use proc SQL :into to construct a macro variable with the code in it, using dictionary tables. Something like this: Proc SQL; Select "Data j; set j; " || name || " = {operation}; run;" Into :macvar separated by ' ' From dictionary.columns Where name like '%_suffix'; Quit; &amp;amp;macvar.
Do you know how to use %IF-%THEN-%ELSE? You could have it test whether the parameter contains any text, and if it doesn't then don't use the CLASS statement at all, if it does then use the value of the parameter as the grouping variable name.
nope. pretty much all we've used macros for is situations where we were doing a bunch of repetitive statements with different variables and wanted to make them more efficient by using macros to replace variables. 
yeah, I also sent an email off to hopefully get some sort of idea what exactly they are looking for. worst comes to worst it's just one question and i'll figure it out after they give out the solutions.
That is a great attitude. Good luck!

Thank you for your reply. I am trying to juggle learning SAS, R and Full stack development as soon as my exams are over. 
Do a PROC SQL step in SAS, connect to your DB and insert your query into the PROC SQL step. 
You are absolutely right. Unfortunately you need a seperate licence for IML as it is not included in sas base or sas stat
I have a free tutorial series on SAS. It should help you for the basics for the exam. Check out YouTube, Mike's SAS tutorials
I'm not a statistician but I am pretty familiar with SAS procedure syntax. Check out [this sample](http://support.sas.com/kb/24/455.html) that includes examples of LOGISTIC and GLIMMIX. You can use (EVENT='1') in the MODEL statement, just as you can in LOGISTIC. For deeper answers from SAS-savvy statisticians, try [the SAS Support Communities](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Statistical-Procedures/bd-p/statistical_procedures).
Get the base SAS certification book. Read the entire book, re-read and then practice in the SAS software. Practice the multiple choice and take the certification exam. It shouldn't take more than 3 months. Get the advance certification book, practice those before taking the advance certification. Refer: https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat480/ https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat481/ https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat482/
You might try using tranwrd as well
Have you considered using macro over array? %do I=1 %to &amp;number.; %do j=1 %to &amp;nletter; Substr(&amp;varname.&amp;i. , &amp;j.)=......... ; %end; %end;
I'm not sure where you're getting these gross generalities, but you can find loads of SAS information by Googling. SAS has also been around nearly twice as long as R. There are many people throughout the world with at least some proficiency in SAS. While R is gaining in popularity, SAS is still widely used in financial services, pharmaceuticals, and statistics.
You can append/interleave and create an additional key to keep track of which dataset each row came from, e.g. data want; set have1(in = h1) have2(in = h2); by keyvar; /*required if you want to interleave in keyvar order rather than appending*/ if h1 then extrakeyvar = 1; if h2 then extrakeyvar = 2; run;
[Here are some SAS/STAT procedures for discriminant analysis](https://support.sas.com/rnd/app/stat/procedures/DiscriminantAnalysis.html) The descriptions may help you choose which one to perform. [You can obtain Bartlett's test of sphericity in SAS/STAT by specifying the options METHOD=ML and HEYWOOD on the PROC FACTOR statement.](http://support.sas.com/kb/33/323.html) [A bit more on using PROC FACTOR](http://go.documentation.sas.com/#!/?cdcId=statcdc&amp;cdcVersion=14.2&amp;docsetId=statug&amp;docsetTarget=statug_factor_overview02.htm&amp;locale=en)
From your description, your data and scenario seem closest to this [example in the SAS documentation](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/68162/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_logistic_examples02.htm), which you might be able to adapt. You might need to drop out of the Logistic Regression task to do a bit of coding (CONTRAST statements, maybe) if you want to generate all of the similar output.
Without example code and more details it's very hard to tell what you mean, but you may look into macros or changing ODS (output delivery system).
If your are using PROC LOGISTIC you can also use SCORE statement to get the probabilities, [see here](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/68162/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_logistic_syntax31.htm). 
You can use either for a regular logistic regression, but Is your outcome 2 levels if anxiety (i.e. binary) or does it have multiple levels (ordinal)? If the latter, you can look into ordinal logistic regression. I think you use proc genmod for ordinal logistic regression. 
The outcome is multiple levels (ordinal) of anxiety... so I'll try ordinal. Thanks! 
Okay, if I'm reading this correctly, you want values A6.01 - A6.09 to be stored into a range. Try using Proc sql statement. Proc sql ; Select character_variable into : macro_variable_name separated by " " from table_name; Quit; Separated by statement can be followed by space, or comma or whatever within the apostrophes depending on how your values are separated by. 
You would need to write some custom data step logic to do this. E.g. data example; ICD10='A6.00-09'; RANGE_START = input(scan(ICD10,2,'.-'),2.); RANGE_END = input(scan(ICD10,3,'.-'),2.); do i = RANGE_START to RANGE_END; ICD10_SPLIT = cats(substr(ICD10,1,3),put(i, z2.)); output; end; drop i; run;
 options mprint source notes symbolgen; data table1; format CHAR_VAR $ 200.; CHAR_VAR = "A6.0-9"; output; CHAR_VAR = "B6.41-58"; output; CHAR_VAR = "Z7.3-18"; output; run; %macro looplist(tbl=); data _null_; %let id=%sysfunc(open(&amp;tbl)); %let NObs=%sysfunc(attrn(&amp;id,NOBS)); %let id=%sysfunc(close(&amp;id)); run; %do j = 1 %to &amp;NObs; data _null_; format pref rlow rhigh $ 200.; set &amp;tbl (firstobs = &amp;j obs = &amp;j); /* you probably want to work with this more depending on your data, but the idea is to make a SAS array name and store it in a macro variable */ pref = substr(CHAR_VAR, 1, index(CHAR_VAR, "." )); rlow = substr(CHAR_VAR, index(CHAR_VAR, "." )+1,length(CHAR_VAR)-index(CHAR_VAR, "-" )); if index(rlow,"-")&gt;0 then rlow = substr(rlow,1,length(rlow)-1); rhigh = substr(CHAR_VAR, index(CHAR_VAR, "-" )+1); pref = tranwrd(pref, "." , "hld" ); rlow = compress(cat(pref, "0" ,rlow)); rhigh = compress(cat(pref, "0" ,rhigh)); arrnm = catt(rlow,"-",rhigh); call symput('arrnm' , arrnm); run; data hld_&amp;j (keep=CHAR_VAR); array charvars{*} &amp;arrnm; do i = 1 to dim(charvars); CHAR_VAR = tranwrd(vname(charvars{i}),"hld","."); output; end; run; %end; data outtbl; set hld_:; run; %mend; %looplist(tbl=table1); Something like that?...
This is actually easier (and more likely to be accurate) if you download an ICD10 code table and do a range join against it. If you happen to have odd variable positioning (like you do) then you'd want to do a substring, replacing the last character before the '-' with the character after the '-' and use them as your criteria for the range join. That way you don't miss anything, regardless of how many digits or variants you have. This is especially important with ICD codes because they can have non-numeric endings. After all for V97.33 you'd need V97.33XA, XD, and XS. If you skip v97.33XD then how will somebody know it wasn't the initial occurrence of getting sucked into a jet engine? (I love ICD 10)
Thank you! I'll give this a try soon.
Thank you! I'll give this a try. I appreciate it :)
Thank you, I'll let you know how it goes. I really appreciate the help :)
I would probably output the proc print in ODS HTML. That is probably the best shot that the link would actually work. I'm not sure if the code to add the "click here" would resolve within the proc print or just show the HTML code. If that doesn't work, you could always read in the HTML file generated by ODS HTML and write it back out with the links added. 
Use SCAN to get the upper and lower bounds and use a DO loop to generate your entries between them.
Most industries and governmental agencies still use SAS (and sometimes require it). Plus, R sucks. 
There are lots of ways. Here's one: proc sort data=mydata; by volcano erupt_dt; run; data eruptgt3; set mydata; by volcano erupt_dt; if first.volcano then ctr = 0; ctr + 1; if last.volcano and ctr &gt; 3 then output; run; As an added bonus, you'll also get the most recent eruption in the eruptgt3 data set. Edit: Sorry, I misread as greater than or equal to 3 at first.
Sounds like you can. PROC GLM is a good choice. See: http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/sas/library/repeated_ut.htm 
So I finally got this figured out and a couple of the comments were close, but the best way without making a full macro loop is to initialize the variables outside of the DATA step and loops using an %IF %THEN as several of you pointed out. There are two more points though. There needs to be a macro %IF statement for each case inside the looping inside of the DATA step using the previously initialized macro variables. (This ends up looking odd due to a lot of END; and %END; inside the loop to close things where they need to be. After the DATA step ends, you need to keep and drop the macro variables that you used using another %IF %THEN. Hopefully this helps someone in the future. (I will try to post the working code later today or tomorrow if I remember.)
Glad to help!
Probably the simplest is just using a little bit of SQL. proc sql; create table work.filtered_volcanoes as select volcano, eruption_date from work.volcanoes group by volcano having count(*) &gt;= 3; run;
I always get bashed on this sub for using proc freq, but I love how few lines it takes: proc freq data=&lt;your data&gt; noprint ; tables volcano / out=test (where=(count&gt;3)) ; run ; 
No reason to bash -- that's probably the simplest solution. The freq output data set is so much simpler than means/summary if all you want is a count. I think you'd need to remove "*eruption_date" from the tables statement, though, as that would create one observation in the output data set for each volcano/eruption_date combination.
0. Use more descriptive dataset names to make the flow of your code easier to follow. 1. Apply the most restrictive possible `keep` statements at the earliest possible points in your code, as this will keep the size of all the downstream datasets to a minimum and speed up processing. 2. Replace datasets with views wherever possible. 3. If disk I/O is a limiting factor rather than CPU and your datasets are very wide even after applying keep statements, enable dataset compression. 4. Why are you splitting your dataset only to join it back together again? Don't do that. You can identify the non-duplicates in one pass. 5. Cartesian joins are really slow. Any other sort of join is going to be much faster. Putting it all together: _ data v_mydata / view = v_mydata; set data1(keep = var1-var4); by var4; if first.var4 then x =0; x + 1; run; proc sql; create table want as select a.var1,b.var2, 'FOX' as var3 from v_mydata a inner join v_mydata b on a.var1=b.var2 where a.x &lt; b.x; quit; 
 data temp; dt1 = 'November 6, 2012'; dt2 = input(dt1, anydtdte30.); format dt2 yymmdds10.; run;
You can put `... birthday="&amp;start"d ...` I believe. It'll resolve to a string and then convert to a date with a d following it.
This is the easiest way, OP. A harder way would be using the scan function with a comma delimiter to get the first word into a month variable, then the date in its own, then the year. Then put them all together with an MDY function, after converting the month with an informat. If you run into REALLY wonky date formats, it's good to know both options exist. Remember - in SAS, there's always another way to do it. 
Yeah, that's how I started to do it and got stuck because I couldn't find an informat to read the full month name. I ran across anydtdte to do that and discovered it could read in the whole date at once. I have also noticed this informat in logs where I convert from Excel to SAS in Enterprise Guide.
Oh yeah, reading in month names is a pain, I forgot. In the future if you need to, you can do a substring on the first three letters, and then concatenate with date in z2. format, and year. So like... Date2=input (cats(put(daynum,z2.),upcase (substr (monstring,1,3)),yearnum),date9.) 
Yes, good idea. That would work.
I'm having trouble figuring out what your end goal is here. Can you give a snapshot of the data and what you actually want to accomplish? There may be a much faster way.
Yep, I do this all the time. It would look like this: %let start=01JAN2016; and then in the data step, I could use: where birthday = "&amp;start"d
I've been using this both on Virtualbox and on AWS for a while now. I think Amazon recently changed the AWS interface, so the SAS instructions may be slightly out of date.
Haha! I didn't have the patience for VirtualBox. I might have to give it another try now...
My old instance still works if I start the instance and connect to the public DNS url for it. I think you might be able to do the same if you go down the manual start route?
Make sure you enable virtualization for your OS, and it should be a simple setup. 
thank you. I will try this weekend
Hi, I am trying this but it is not working. Why did you write Set Old? Am I to write set old as well or should it be the name of the original dataset from which columns will be taken? thank you
replace "new" and "old" with the names of your datasets
Based on what you suggested, [Previous stock price (the precedent stock price) always ends up being equal to 0](http://i.imgur.com/1dZlNMB.jpg), [which makes the final operation in the formula none dividable](http://i.imgur.com/8gdepGg.jpg). So I get this [table with no return on stock](http://i.imgur.com/8sO4ToE.jpg). any suggestions? getting the price stock above the current one is the problem. thank you
I have used the xml libname engine and a manually created xml map to read in data from posts to SASBIWS. The issues I have run into are: If the text is longer than the field length, I think there was a warning in the log but it just imported the field truncated. If the xml is flat everything should work out great. I had some initial issues with hierarchical xml. Try to get a bunch of sample xml payloads and to ensure whatever comes out of xml mapper meets your requirements. I usually spend a bit of time tweaking the results from it.
I just popped the below into excel: &amp;nbsp; yolo | swag | ---------|----------| 500 | 1,000 | 2,000 | 600 | &amp;nbsp; and exported to CSV which yielded: &amp;nbsp; yolo,swag, 500,"1,000", "2,000",600, &amp;nbsp; As you notice, anything &gt;= 1000, or alternatively has a comma in it, receives quotes around it. SAS interprets these as text values. &amp;nbsp; Try taking a look at your csv file. 
No honey, I just like using industry leading tools. 
Depending on the nature of your workflow, I've had to use an infile statement to force to numeric in this situation. If you look at the log generated by running proc import, it should write an infile step that you can copy into your script and edit the necessary variables to numeric. This is a pain in the ass (which is why proc import was written in the first place), but should work for you.
I don't usually used PROC IMPORT for reading CSV files because it guesses wrong on the column type or length too often for my taste. You can look in the log, copy the code you see there, and alter it to your preferences. Then all the columns will be exactly what you want. Or just write your own code. Say we have a CSV file containing a text ID column followed by two numeric columns, with the column names in the first row. We tell SAS where the file is, tell it to skip the first row (`firstobs=2`) and that a line is at most, say, 50 characters long. Use an `informat` statement to make sure the text column is read as character data and is however many characters you want it to be (5 in the example). data mydata; infile "path-to-file/datafile.csv" delimiter="," dsd firstobs=2 lrecl=50 stopover; informat ID $5.; input ID x y; run;

Thank you.
Theres a function somewhere to create an output of all unique combinations of variables im sure...i think i used it for creating some test datasets to ensure i completed test cases for all values within an xml file i was working with. When i get to the office i will have a dig into my files and see if i can find it 
No problem!
Look into hexadecimal compress test = compress(string,'09'X) ;
That was an example, you can try the space Hexa code. 
I actually figured it out, I used a CATS statement.
Think you can use +(-1) in output string to move the cursor back a space...i like this method for some reason 
Unfortunately, I need the double quotes as the final output because I dont think MS DOS recognizes the single quotes. I tested it out and can confirm that it doesn't run if I switch the two around. 
Hmm I havent thought of it like that. I will look into it on Monday, thanks!
This is a very good situation to try the new SAS function: %tslit() Try this: char_new=%tslit("C:\Program Files\SASHome\x86\SASFoundation\9.4\sas.exe" -SYSIN "&amp;folder_path\"); Source and other ways to do this: http://support.sas.com/kb/25/076.html
Learn something new every day!
I did not know of the retain statement so I tried to make due with what I know. I don't understand the documentation on retain. Can you give me a hint or point me to a page with actual examples? The official SAS docu lacks that.
Yup. Happens to me too. I thought it was just an issue with my Mac cursor pad
So the macro works, but now I have one small issue. Within my progs data set, I have a variable called file_name where it lists all the file names with .sas extension within the directory. i.e. my sas code.sas Any suggestions on how to append my sas code.sas after &amp;folder_path so that it looks like this: "C:\Program Files\SASHome\x86\SASFoundation\9.4\sas.exe" -SYSIN "C:\Desktop\my sas code.sas" 
 full_file_path="C:\Desktop\"||strip(file_name); or if the base path varies and you have a variable for it: full_file_path=strip(path_variable)||strip(file_name); Don't forget to include a length statement for Full_file_path or you'll very likely end up with truncations.
I don't believe that would give me the output that I want. I need the " after the concatenated file_name. 
Do you mean you want the variable in the dataset to be: "C:\Desktop\xyz.sas" rather than: C:\Desktop\xyz.sas If the former you can use: full_file_path='"C:\Desktop\'||strip(file_name)||'"'; If you want the later then the code I gave you should work. It's just concatenating a text variable (file_name) onto the end of a string ("C:\Desktop\"). EDIT: Or are you trying to call these files in the code rather than create them in a dataset?
thank you 
Awesome. Good to know. 
You'll need to use explicit `output` statements, rather than the implicit one in your data step. Output once before changing the values and once after (unless your datastep has a 'modify' statement, in which case just output and stop).
With that kind of knowledge, your first SAS job would be the biggest challenge, assuming you can remember and can explain how to use what you have learnt. But not too much of a challenge, make sure You put the SAS certified logo on your resume. It will get you more interviews than without. You are well set for the job industry especially with a math degree. Good luck!
I think your first job really sets the trajectory of your future. Of course you can always change but it gets more difficult the older you get. My advice to you (coming from someone who entered the field with just a bachelors and later got my masters, now makes well over six figures) is to make sure you get a job actually analyzing data, not just programming. Programmers get grunt work and are looked at less highly than data analysts and above that modelers. I don't think you will be able to get a modeling job without a masters so look for titles like data analyst or quantitative analyst (different from quants) and stay away from programmer titles. Try to hold out if you can to get a job that aligns with your math background.
I agree with most of what /u/ckatem posted. I started working as a laborer at 17. I'm a data programmer/data analyst now 11 years later. I only have certs. They helped with raises. Analyzing data definitely gets me more interesting work. The people who only program get stuck doing blind validation all day. The clinical development scene has a lot of jobs where it's good to know about math, health and programming together. If you only know one of those then you get suckered into programming, stats or listing review all day every day. 
I prefer spaces.
Try notepad++ I'm sure there's a file to color code SAS. Also: tab key. Just keep consistent logic throughout a file on how you use tab and you should be fine.
Team Tabs!
Not to my knowledge. You need to pay to get in the door basically. I know it sucks but it is what it is. If you are still in college, hit up the computer store and see if they have $50 1-year SAS license and then start practicing online examples.
There are a collection of tutorials here, and two free courses: http://support.sas.com/training/tutorial/ And if you are a student grab the SAS University Edition and run it in a vm 
Seconded. Also with regards to the call symput question, you can use them, they're just done in data steps, not open code.
Your post was auto-moderated to be spam (for some unknown reason), and is now 2 days old before it was cleared. Feel free to ask this again.
If you prepend your code with four spaces, reddit will format it as a code block like this: %macro something(); proc contents data=work.blah; %mend; 
Ok, in the first macro what is the %runquiy doing and what are the %puts at the end doing? And how is the distribution list set up?
Whats the report? An Excel file? Or is this a notification of a report that has been sent? Also you cant create a macro within a macro using the select into. Attached is the code that you would need if I am reading this right. data distribution_list; length email_address $50.; input email_address $ autonumber report_received; datalines; email1@email.com 1 1 email1@email.com 2 2 email2@email.com 3 3 email3@email.com 4 4 email4@email.com 5 5 run; %macro createdistro_lists; %do autonumber = 1 %to 5; proc sql noprint; select email_address into: email from work.distribution_list where autonumber=&amp;autonumber; quit; proc sql noprint; select report_received into: report from work.distribution_list where autonumber=&amp;autonumber; quit; %put &amp;email&amp;autonumber.. ; %put &amp;report&amp;autonumber.. ; filename efile email; data _null_; file efile TO= (&amp;email&amp;autonumber.) SUBJECT= "Report Summary"; put "We have noted that you received the following reports. Please confirm that this report is still in use. Unused Reports will be retired."; put ' '; PUT "&amp;report&amp;autonumber.."; PUT " "; PUT "Regards,"; run; %end; %mend; %createdistro_lists; 
I agree with shezadaa's main point. You don't want to be facing a deadline and you are rushing to understand this program, especially as a new SAS user. I encourage you to try and keep the old process, but understand it when you have time. Once your understanding seems good enough then you can try to rewrite it if you have time.
Great explanation, thank you very much. Just one subquestion, to fully understand. &gt; and then whether there is any leftover difference between individual cells What does leftover mean? So there are differences, but they are already described in difference between oils or extracts, so oil+extract doesn't have much left? From this it's clear I'm trying to answer to the model/question 2. But I guess the oil*extract interaction is not even important, so I might as well just do it like this: proc glm data=sas; class OIL Extract; model data = OIL Extract /solution e; lsmeans OIL Extract /pdiff stderr adjust= tukey lines; run; Again, thank you so much for your answers. Best.
Do you mean contrast or estimate statements?
Untested, but I think this should work. PROC SORT; DATA=oldds; BY a date; RUN; * You have to SORT to get the BY clause to work in the DATA step; DATA newds; SET oldds; BY A; RETAIN Delta 0; IF FIRST.A THEN Delta = Amount; Delta = Delta - Amount; LABEL Delta = 'Frequency'; OUTPUT; Delta = Amount; RUN; *** If you really don't like neg values in frequency then insert below before OUTPUT line; LENGTH X $4; IF Delta &gt; 0 THEN X = 'Drop'; ELSE IF Delta &lt; 0 THEN X = 'Add'; ELSE X = '0'; Delta = ABS(Delta); 
Can you try it as a CSV file? Size should reduce significantly.
Sorry, it is a CSV file, should have specified!
* Open up the csv file in your favourite text editor. Don't use notepad as it will probably crash. * Split it into 3 files of a roughly equal number of rows * Copy the header row over to the 2 smaller files Alternatively, zip your csv file, and if the resulting zip file is 10mb or less you should be able to upload it in one go and process it using the [zip filename engine](http://blogs.sas.com/content/sasdummy/2015/05/11/using-filename-zip-to-unzip-and-read-data-files-in-sas/).
Why don't you show us an example of your data and what you've tried so far?
Output using obs / endobs and split output into separate datasets then export to csv. These can be merged later using excel or sas (or notepad i guess)...dont manually split them unless you have no alternative means as it compromises the integrity of the data and more inconveniently will take ages... If you cant figure out obs / startobs/ endobs etc then add a variable to dataset using count = monotonic(); Then split your datasets using the value of count as a range. (on mobile so syntax is wrong but you should get the drift) Data a b c; Set maindataset; Count=monotonic(); If count between 1 and 1000 output a; If count between 1001 and 2000 output b; If count &gt; 2000 output c; Run; Then do proc export on each dataset a b and c and so on. You could consider dynamically outputting the datasets using a loop but seems pointless if this is a one off exercise. 
The difference between genmod and glimmix is that genmod use generalized estimating equation (moment based method) to estimate the covariances, and glimmix use Maximum likelihood approach. Support for certain parametrization of the design matrix is also slightly different, but minor.
That is not true. The consistency of OLS estimator is under the context in linear model with misspecified covariance structure . In generalized linear mixed model, the ML-based estimator for regression coefficient can be influenced by the misspecification of the covariance according to literature.
As MJGSimple suggested, you want to have your dataset constructed appropriately. i.e. DATA ... INPUT ID T Y A B; DATALINES; 1 1 y11 a11 b11 1 2 y12 a12 b12 1 3 y13 a13 b13 2 1 y21 a21 b21 ... ; RUN; And use something like below for the analysis: PROC ... model y=A*(T=2 or T=3)+B*(T=1 or T=3); ... RUN;
Was messing around so now the popup won't appear when I start PC SAS.
Honestly, I hated learning SAS in a class setting (undergrad). I would zone out on all the tutorial because it was basically the TA giving the demo. When it came to the assignment, I just did the questions like the demo. Overall, I didn't learn anything aside from opening it. It would've been a different experience if it was a project and we got to figure it out on our own. So I'm not sure what the master program that you're interested is like (more independent research?). I learned SAS luckily through my first internship. It's way easier when you work with with real data rather than demo data (perfect data doesn't exists in the real world). I suggest reading any SAS beginner book and watching YT clips. Not sure how you will get access to SAS since it's expensive..
Where was your internship that you learned SAS? In undergrad I took an intro to SAS class and worked on a project. I just wanted to advanced my skills more for data analyst jobs
NC State MS in Analytics. It is heavily stats focused / partners with SAS institute.. If you want, you can graduate with multiple SAS certs. They also pay for them
My guess is the "%test2" command doesn't actually end (execute) until the processor encounters a ";", another "%", or the beginnings of another SAS statement ("proc ...", "data ...", etc.). So when you submit %test2 with nothing else below it, SAS is waiting for something else to be submitted (a ";" or perhaps some parameters in parentheses), before it considers the "%test" command to be done. I didn't try this, but I bet if you submit ; by itself, the previous %test2 command you submitted would then execute. (Not that I'm saying you'd want to normally do this. As we saw, all of this can be avoided by just putting semicolons at the end of each line.) I'll also guess this doesn't happen in batch mode, and is a feature of interactive mode only. EDIT: As part of my programming practice, I always do these three things: * End every data step and proc with "run;" * End every line with ";" (unless it is a continuation of the previous line) * End every macro variable call with "." (e.g. "&amp;a.") I've been burned by not having the period at the end in complicated macro constructions. If there's a semicolon right there (e.g. "&amp;a;"), like in your example, that's OK though.
Hi, sorry for late reply. Your code worked, thanks. I have a question though, some of my ICD10 codes from CMS are short (i.e. A00.0, A00.1). The result after adding the decimal point is: A00.00, A00.01, A00.09, etc. What do you suggest? When I shortened (string_no_point,3,2) to ,3,1, it was leaving out numbers such as: A02.21 was now A02.2.
SAS has [Joint Certificate programs](http://www.sas.com/en_us/learn/academic-programs/resources/joint-certificate-program.html) at several institutions. They are offered at the undergraduate and graduate levels. [Here's an article](http://time.com/money/4328180/most-valuable-career-skills/) from MONEY about which career skills are valuable. It looks like being able to make sense of Big Data is going to be the main driver of future careers. You can [learn SAS for free](http://www.sas.com/en_us/learn/academic-programs/students.html) and practice the skills you've learned with SAS University Edition or SAS OnDemand for Academics. There are also [200+ free tutorials](http://support.sas.com/training/tutorial/) at your disposal if you get stuck! 
I seem to be getting errors. Is it like: string_no_point = "ABCD"; string_with_point = substr(string_no_point,1,2) || "." || substr(string_no_point, 3, 2); Post_decimal_point = substr(stringnopoint, 3, length(stringnopoint) - 3) My error says "invalid third argument to function SUBSTR...
I still get the same error :/ It's referring to the substr after ||
Maybe it is because it cannot evaluate the length? Calculate it outside of the substr and try again like this: end_point = length(string_no_point) - 3; string_with_point = substr(string_no_point,1,2) || "." || substr(string_no_point, 3, end_point); That should work. If not, do some experimenting.
Here's a great list of institutions that offer a master's program with a SAS focus! http://www.sas.com/content/dam/SAS/en_us/doc/other1/masters-program.pdf As for your question on marketability, both are extremely marketable considering the shortfall of analytical talent. It truly depends on the area of domain expertise, and the career on which you are focused. Good luck!
Try to start here: kaggle.com and make a profile. Then go here - coursera.org - take the Data Mining and Data Science specializations and pass them with all of the programs completed. Then start participating in kaggle competitions and competing to make yourself more experienced in the data science realm.
You might consider looking into Bio-statistics. I work for a large CRO in the bio-statistics department and I have a masters in economics, and one of my coworkers has a biology degree. If you can program R or SAS or have a biology background, it could be a good fit.
If I could piggyback off of this post, I'm an economics masters student (health specialization if that helps) looking to get into data science. Looking at job descriptions, I see all kinds of statistical methods and techniques that I am not familiar with (k-means clustering, neural networks, etc). I am, however, very familiar with regression and time series data analysis due to my program, mainly with the use of SAS. I try to learn R and Python by myself on the side to widen my skillset. My question is, does the lack of the variety of my statistics knowledge hurt my chances of getting into the field, or will it be viewed as a positive that I am well versed in the fundamentals of the models that I do know (econometrics)? I want to start applying to jobs/internships and am concerned about what would be asked in terms of technical knowledge. If it helps, I am also trying to learn some of the more advanced statistical methods on the side as I am pretty confident in my math skills.
No offense but I worked for a CRO....do you actually like it?!? You're like a cog in a machine doing the same thing over and over again. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they can't find a job. And even then I would say hold out until you find something else.
I'm not 100% sure offhand (not at a real computer), but I think this might error if the result is non-integer. Sometimes you need to use %sysevalf() instead of %eval(), if you can get non-integer results. It's used the same way.
I'm in a similar position as OP. Thanks for your comment! It really helps.
The problem with your code is that you're trying to create 4 variables, all called "n" but with different labels, and you're not separating the variables with commas. Try doing it as: select count(*) as tot_obs "Total number of observations", count(x1) as tot_x1 "Total number of x1 observations", count(x2) as tot_x2 "Total number of x2 observations", count(c1) as tot_c1 "Total number of c1 observations" from mary;
Yes! Thank you, this is exactly what I needed.
wouldn't that only do it for one variable (the one called x1)?
I've seen this type of problem before (and solved it, I think), but I'm not at a PC with SAS on it now so I can't look up the exact code. I'll try to assist you from memory. It is caused by the Across variable, Proc Report loses the ability reference aliases, so you have to explicitly tell it in which column the calculated values will go into. You have to use the absolute column references, and then in the compute block you have to add a line of code for each year that will have a gpa calculation. Try using something like this in the compute block: compute gpa; _C4_ = _C2_/_C3_; endcomp; or: compute gpa; _C4_ = _C2_.sum/_C3_.sum; endcomp; If your ay variable has multiple levels, for instance 2014,2015,2016 you'll have to add 3 lines to the compute block each one calculating the gpa for the given year. In each calculation you'll have to explicitly give it the column the answer will go into as well as the columns that are used to calculated that specific gpa. I'll be back in the office tomorrow (in about 16 hours), I'll try to find my code example that works to post here. Happy coding!
Thanks, those documents helped. It turns out you don't need the .sum for what I'm doing. just a _c4_ = _c2/_c3_ for each category of the across variable. Worked perfectly. Thanks for the reference documents. I've bookmarked them and hopefully will be using proc report more in the future. Cheers!
Yes. A separate report could be created for each, or they could be combined in one report.
use proc means with a by statement
what he said
and don't forget to proc sort by the analysis variable before.
as /u/Jhinra mentioned if you have a prompt that accepts multiple values, like a multi-select dropdown you'll find the other values listed as the article he linked mentions. However if you have an open text field that you users can type the string ('NY', 'NJ' 'MA') into then your sql won't work because your where statement is incomplete, you'd need to design your where statement like WHERE "&amp;PROMPT" CONTAINS STATE You MAY also be able to use the Quote() function to quote the macro variable instead of using double quotes.

Does is have to be SQL code? In my experience SQL is not well suited to this form of processing. Is a data step or some other PROC an option? If so I recommend the double-sort NODUPKEY technique below: /* NB: IN is OP's input dataset */ /* prep the data by sorting id and date for grouping, then sorting by desc date2 so that highest value date2 is at the 1st row of each group */ proc sort data=in; by id date descending date2; where date gt date2; run; /* sorting now by id and date ONLY, use NODUPKEY to keep only the 1st row of every group */ proc sort data=in nodupkey; by id date; run;
select id, date, max(date2) as seconddatefield, version from mytable where date2 &lt; date group by id, date --?
There's a code node that will output the code from the model.
Sorry, but the only code node I can find is "SAS Code," which is not what I need.
I'd use Proc Sort and the Data step Proc Sort Data=in ; by id date descending date2; run; data out; set in by id date; /* you might need a comma between ID and Date, I can't remember */ if last.date; /* Seriously check out the data step's first and last operators. */ run;
Have a go at doing this yourself first. Take it one step at a time and post a more specific question if you get stuck on a particular point.
I think that it's in the output option. I'll read up tonight and reply back. 
I'm a statistical programmer who also got my first job without the cert. Got it a few months back and have noticed a significant increase in recruiters contacting me. So that might be possible assuming you put your resume on a job site. 
Best advice I can give you here is to take what you just explained there's and map it out on paper. Step by step - I've got this, I need to group by this, and this, and I need this to sum this, etc. Through to the end goal, which is the layout you know you want. Then take it chunk by chunk - make a data step or an SQL procedure doing just one small task - does it get you closer? If so great, create another separate step, rinse and repeat. You'll end up with pretty inefficient code but you'll know exactly what it's doing. Once you have it working, you can then go back and clean it up. This is pretty generic advice I know, but the reality is that your post has a lot going on in it! The only specific thing I'll say is that your idea of having an end template is a good one. Build it in SAS (or import it, but I'd recommend the latter because you can use a loop to make SAS rebuild it for you each month with the required rows and columns as time progresses. You then know what your results will need to merge to, and whether you work backwards or towards that is up to you.
Do you mind if I ask you about your educational &amp; related experience background? I recently got both base &amp; advanced certs, but haven't been able to find any work since I don't have a numerical/programming degree or relevant experience. Thanks!
Thanks!
Have done so, please see: https://www.reddit.com/r/sas/comments/5tj3g0/help_coding_rules_to_create_a_dynamic_dataset/
love the non proc sql solutions in this thread. I see my analysts clinging to proc sql for all solutions to their coding tasks. I have begun challenging them by making them complete some of their projects with NO proc sql code at all. There is a reason proc sql is not covered in base SAS courses :)
Have you tried reading them in with ANYDATE8. to see if it really is a problem?
mmddyy8. will be fine, but if OP read them in as a character value first, they'd have to convert them back to numeric. 
Mmddyy8.
 data dates; infile datalines dlm=' '; input date1-date4; format date1-date4 mmddyy10.; informat date1-date4 mmddyy10.; datalines; 1/1/13 12/5/16 1/17/14 10/13/16 ; run; 
Just a few things that might help -- be sure you input a character variable to a date informat. If the variable starts out as numeric (for example, 20170213), change it to character and then input to date, like this: sasdt = input(put(numdt, z8.), yymmdd8.); Also, be sure to use a format statement after you have created your date variable, something like this: format sasdt yymmdds10.; That will help a lot with readability, but remember that the value of the variable is still the numeric number of days since Jan. 1, 1960.
If you can, grab the practice exam on the SAS website. Here are some a few sites that have old questions. It's been 6+ months, but I want to say a few of the questions were still being used. Best of luck! http://sas-certification-questions.blogspot.com/ http://www.listendata.com/2014/05/sas-base-certification-questions-with.html
Agreed. I've taken several certification exams, and this is the one I describe as the hardest I've taken, just because there were so many things intended to trip you up. I used the SAS Base Programming book and Learning SAS by Example.
Practice question dump and practice those before the exam. Good luck!
Can't say that I can definitively understand or solve your problem, but perhaps an alternate method of re-coding would help. Try: Troublea = floor(trouble); Instead of: if trouble &lt; 2 then troublea = 1; else if trouble &lt;3 then troublea =2;
If your data are truly discrete, I can't quite understand how they got imported with interval values. Round() or floor() might be best to clean the data which might solve your problems.
Me neither! :D Thanks - floor seems to have worked better and resolved the issue with values not calculating properly. I think I know what happened... I have a macro that replaces any values greater than 4 standard deviations from the mean with mean+std*4. So, that explains why the values are "off"... what it doesn't explain is why I can't see them in proc freq. I still think it might be formatting but since floor solves my immediate problem, I'll use that and return to the issue later so I don't do it again. Thanks for your help!
Thank you so much! 
To add to this thread, you can also check out this 'Get Started with SAS' resource for all free resources available to you. http://support.sas.com/training/us/sp1.html 200+ tutorials, 2 free eLearnings as well as recommended learning paths. throughthekeyhole mentioned University Edition, that is def an option to get access for learning purposes. Hope this helps and good luck!
There are a lot of reports that can be created in SAS, but they don't work like pivot tables at all -- they would just be static. But SAS can definitely be used to create the data that goes into the pivot table. I would look at SAS as a complement to Excel -- not a replacement.
Is the "become" command starting a new shell?
I'm not sure, as my Linux chops aren't that great as of yet. It's possible though, as anything past that point in the script doesn't get executed (most likely until logging out of the 'become' user account). I've inquired about the possibility of getting sudo rights to run SAS as the user in question instead. 
Use ODS TRACE ON to get a list of summary tables that are created in the results output. You can then odd output the specific table and then I'd create a macro variable to output the AIC value into a new dataset. I did something very similar recently using PROC ARIMA to great effect. 
proc tabulate. counts, means, percentages, etc... 
Check out the SAS add-in for Microsoft Office. You get the best of both worlds... Great processing and calculating from SAS, excel interface folks are used to.
Could you elaborate more? I have tried using ODS TRACE ON in conjunction with ODS OUTPUT. However, after when I copy+paste the ODS TRACE ON path (got it from Log result) into ODS OUTPUT, it keeps saying that the name/label/path for ODS OUTPUT is incorrect. Would be great if you can post the code you used for your PROC ARIMA procedure too.
Using the ODS trace on option will list in the log the name of each table produced in the results viewer. &gt;[ODS produces an output object by combining data \(the data component\) with a table definition. The trace record provides information about the data component, the table definition, and the output object. By default, the record that the ODS TRACE statement produces contains these items.](https://v8doc.sas.com/sashtml/ods/z0384850.htm) You can then use the ods output statement to output these tables as a dataset from which you can pull the information you need from it. See [here](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/odsug/69832/HTML/default/viewer.htm#p0oxrbinw6fjuwn1x23qam6dntyd.htm) for more info on ods output. I don't have access to my work stuff at the moment so can't share the code, but have a play with those options and you'll find it fairly straight forward.
I still have problem. Here is the [code](http://i.imgur.com/2MuoSWZ.png), the [output log](http://i.imgur.com/N2DpDpX.png), and the [error log](http://i.imgur.com/eFDKRSh.png).
Okay thanks a lot, i will try to run it. Thanks !
My company just moved everyone using local sas to the grid 😒 it's been a nuisancey nightmare but I'm sure it saves them lots of money. 
"The data set WORK.nhefs2 has 1 observations and 2 variables." - That doesn't sound right. Do you have a SET statement? Can we see your code? Data nhefs2; set nhefs2; (or whatever you're reading in) ... (other statements) run; 
Well... I'm not sure exactly why you'd do that. You can look at R^2 and also look at an F-test to determine if your *model* is significant. But, if one R^2 is higher than another, then the independent variables in that model explain more linear variation in the dependent variable than the independent variables in your other model with lower R^2 (I'll reread this later and take issue with my wording then want to list a bunch of caveats). But overall... you don't really want to do what you're asking, at least not that I'm familiar with. You might want to use adjusted R-squared, which has a slightly different interpretation but penalizes additional predictors. Or, you can compare models based on AIC or SIC (lower is better). They both just calculate the penalty for additional predictors a bit differently. To do that: proc reg data=yourdata outest=teststats; model y = x1 x2 x3 / aic sic adjrsq; run; edit: whoops, forgot an option; AIC SIC have to be output using outest. Just print it!
Thanks. My motivation was model comparison with an F-test (http://people.reed.edu/~jones/Courses/P24.pdf). I'm also replicating a paper where the authors did an F-test to determine whether their full model was an ehancement over the restricted model, but it's certainly possible there are better ways to make the same comparison.
Ah, I see what you're saying now. The test isn't actually determining whether there's a significant change in R^2 . It is a model comparison test, but R^2 doesn't really have anything to do with it. What you want is a partial F-test. Typically I've seen this used to compare a model vs a restricted version of the model (removing some variables, as below). proc reg data=test; model y = x1 x2 x3 x4; model y = x1 x2; run; I'm afraid I don't know of a way to do this directly in SAS, but the basic PROC REG output gives you ANOVA tables. You just need the Error Sums of Squares and the Degrees of Freedom for both models, then use the formula in the presentation you linked. The "RSS_R" is the Error Sum of Squares for the smaller model (fewer predictor variables). You're looking for a table named "Analysis of Variance". The "RSS_F" is the Error Sum of Squares for the full/larger model. So, you'll want both Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tables. df_R - df_f is just the difference in predictor variables. So, if you have y = X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 and want to check out y = X1 + X2, df_R - df_F is 2. Don't overcomplicate it :D Finally - df_f by itself is calculated as n-k-1, or just look at the Error DF for the full model in the ANOVA table. I won't give you an example because there are a bazillion online. [I will give you a great short and easy to understand link though. ](http://bit.ly/2l20CDG) 
I used to work for SAS, and they really do have [a long history](http://blogs.sas.com/content/sastraining/2011/12/07/mmm-dr-g-and-the-mms/) with M&amp;M's. They actually sent me a bag of them with my welcome material at onboarding. 
You are operating under the assumption that BO is a physical database. Most data warehouse applications are (e.g. BO, Cognos; MicroStrategy) are metadata engines that contain business term definitions that operate on an RDBMS database like Oracle or DB2. At our company we use ODBC to connect directly to the data warehouse tables that contain the data and replicate the business terms in SAS. Alternatively, you can connect to the RDBMS and export the SQL generated in BO and incorporate that into PROC SQL to migrate BO reports into the SAS project.

Something like: Describe one or two features in SAS that you couldn't live without and one or two that you have struggled to master. 
That is precisely the problem. I will have a look on the file you've sent, it seems to be very helpful! Thanks, mate!
When working on SAS interactively through SSH you need to have X forwarding in order to generate ODS Graphics. At least, that's the only way I can get it to run. Make sure you have a X server such as Xming on your machine, and have the X11 forwarding box checked off in your putty configuration. Then give it a whirl.
I should also say that ODS graphics relies on the JVM which is the error I would get without forwarding my X connection.
SAS is a validated system that we don't have to do additional checks on to be able to use. Sorry if I misunderstand, but Python and R are just languages right? I would have to validate my own systems if I used those, where as if I use SAS I don't have to do any validations.
You hit the nail on the head yourself there. SAS is a statistical processing software suite. It has some pretty good solution for research data management and some of the tools are ok for medium sized enterprise types of datasets. The programs that you seem to be referencing are database software solutions designed for large enterprise level types of loads. They can find records instantaneously, but they can't fit those records into a non-parametric model and then tell you odds ratios of an event happening.
If you're interested, I just took a college course on SAS, I can send you all our PowerPoints!
Hi there! Adding to cactustaco, you can find those limitations [here](https://support.sas.com/software/products/university-edition/faq/limitations.htm). Hope this helps! 
this won't help for the YYYY one I don't think, but want=input(have,anydtdte.) works pretty well
Very interested! I'm gonna drop you a message. 
Agh, dates! You have my thoughts and prayers, which is the ISO for support these days. If it is a string field then you should append a -01 or -01-01 as required, but you should also create flags to identify which records have had this done (e.g. mydatevar_noday, mydatevar_nomonth), as these date values have a lower accuracy than other records, and you will likely want to acknowledge this in your methods. You should also perform a sensitivity analysis which excludes these records, comparing results with to without.
This almost works. Problem is that it gives MMMYYYY, when I need MMM-YYYY, as in date11. I still haven't found a way to get that output format.
You'll need to use if then else. If length(orig)=10 then new=input(orig,yymmdd10.); Else If length(orig)=8 then new=input(orig,yymmd.); Else If length(orig)=4 then new=input(orig,year.); Refer to the list of acceptable formats. I think for the second part it should be MONYY. http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrcon/69852/HTML/default/viewer.htm#p1wj0wt2ebe2a0n1lv4lem9hdc0v.htm
Thanks! What does din= do? 
why can't you just do %let vlist = 'var1 var2 var3'; proc mean data=data; var &amp;vlist; run;
there is no need for a variable in this case. This should work: data test3; set test2; cr_all_crimes_date = cr_all_crimes||'_'||compress(date); run;
Hmm that doesn't seem to work, I just get: ._2013Q3 ._2013Q4 etc in the column I might not have been clear enough, I have a date in this date column (e.g. 2013Q4), and then I'll have crime stat columns called cr_all_crimes_2013Q3, cr_all_crimes_2013Q4, cr_all_crimes_2014Q1 etc., and where the date is 2013Q4 I want the cr_all_crimes_date column to have the value from cr_all_crimes_2013Q4, and where its 2011Q1 I want the value from cr_all_crimes_2011Q1 etc. I thought this could only be done with macro variables. I have done it in a really roundabout way with a do loop but there must be a more elegant solution? 
Ok, I hope I understood your table. A very inelegant solution would be: &gt; data test3; &gt; set test2; &gt; if cr_all_crimes_2013Q3 ^= . then cr_all_crimes_date = cr_all_crimes_2013Q3; &gt; if cr_all_crimes_2013Q4 ^= . then cr_all_crimes_date = cr_all_crimes_2013Q4; &gt; &gt; run; add new if-clauses for all dates you have 
I'm slightly wined, but let's give this a shot. You would need 2 things, some way of counting the number of variables passed to the macro, this can be easily done by using some unique delimiter between variables that you pass to the macro. (Can't think of a specific solution, but the train of thought should get you somewhere) Secondly, you need to have another macro that calls the loop code, this way you can use a macro that contains the number of variables to call that many instances of the macro containing the loop code. I'm sorry if this is really vague, or not easy to impliment. But I believe it can be done with some clever use of coding. It is indeed an interesting challenge.
Colour me intrigued. I have a concept in mind but am out right now so I'll have a play when I get back and see what I can come up with.
Well, I got something to work, but unfortunately I don't have time right now to explain it. Dumping it here, it's a bit complicated, but it does work: /* making up fake data for example */ data junk; seed=33155; /* random number seed, ignore this */ do i=1 to 100; physician=int(ranuni(seed)*4+1); procedure_code=int(ranuni(seed)*6+1); year=int(ranuni(seed)*8+1); cost=int(ranuni(seed)*100+1); junkvar=1; /* this is a junk variable that is always equal to 1. it will be used below */ output; end; run; %let var1=physician; %let var2=procedure_code; %let var3=year; %let numvar=3; /* 1 = for each, 0 = all */ %let state1=1; %let state2=1; %let state3=0; /* change the above to change the states you want. this example would run for each physician and for each procedure code, for all years */ %macro doloop; /* sort the dataset in the proper order */ proc sort data=junk; by junkvar %do i=1 %to &amp;numvar.; %if &amp;&amp;state&amp;i.=1 %then %do; &amp;&amp;var&amp;i. %end; %end; ; run; /* set up a macro variable to save the output dataset */ data _NULL_; length outputset $ 100; outputset="means"; %do i=1 %to &amp;numvar.; outputset=compress(outputset||"&amp;&amp;state&amp;i."); %end; call symput("outputset",outputset); run; /* run the means */ proc means data=junk stackodsoutput; var cost; by junkvar %do i=1 %to &amp;numvar.; %if &amp;&amp;state&amp;i.=1 %then %do; &amp;&amp;var&amp;i. %end; %end; ; ods output summary=&amp;outputset.; run; %mend; %doloop; So if you run this on combination 1 1 0 (as in my example), you'll get a dataset "Means110" with the statistics. Change the "%let state..." line to change the combination you want to run. This last bit was me setting up running all combinations (which would generate all the datasets Means000 to Means111), which I didn't finish. In theory you want to run %doloop for each row of this dataset. /* run all possibilities of these */ %macro do_all_loops; data all_possibilities; %do i=1 %to &amp;numvar.; do j&amp;i.=0 to 1; &amp;&amp;var&amp;i.=j&amp;i.; %end; output; %do i=1 %to &amp;numvar.; end; %end; run; %mend; %do_all_loops;
PROC SGPLOT supports overlays
PROC SGPLOT DATA = /*mydata*/; VBAR /*myvariable*/ / GROUP = /*x quantity (option)*/; TITLE '/*mytitle*/'; RUN; 
Empty observations should still appear as missing IIRC. Not sure if this will help but I use Proc SQL PROC SQL; CREATE TABLE AS select * FROM GROUP BY HAVING =.; QUIT; 
hmm, discovering that I'd say we should use a put statement of some kind, like %Populate_crame_acc_date (put(acc_qtr_crim,$6.) But that may give unexpected results, give me a moment to test.
OK tested, this isn't possible using macros because the macro invocation happens before the data step resolves. Call Symput, and Call Execute work differently... I think we could do this ENTIRELY in the macro let me get back to you.
OK Macros were a dead end, vvaluex funcition is your friend data t1; set WORK.test ; a=catx('_',"cr_all_crimes",vvaluex("date")); cr_all_crimes_acc_qtr=vvaluex(a); run; 
Ah brilliant, thanks a lot mate. Never used vvaluex before so I've learned something today!
This is great!! 
 Proc sort data=mydata.sampleearliestdate out=want; By ID date; Data want; Set want; By id; If first.ID; Run; The first step sorts the data by ID and ascending order of date. The second step keeps the first observation for each ID.
great, thanks!
Thank you. I tried this with my original dataset and its somehow returning a new dataset with 0 entries. Not quite sure what happened. In the original dataset, there are also invalid IDs that have letters, so the columns are not quite numeric only.
Whoops. ID is saved as a different variable on my original dataset. Here's what i'm getting from the log with the delete in the code: 61 62 Data mydata.originaldatasetDUPIDCLEAN; 63 Set mydata.originaldatasetDUPCLEAN; 64 If verify(nationalID,"0123456789") NE 0 then delete; 65 Run; NOTE: There were 74691 observations read from the data set MYDATA.ORIGINALDATASETDUPCLEAN. NOTE: The data set MYDATA.ORIGINALDATASETDUPIDCLEAN has 0 observations and 45 variables. NOTE: DATA statement used (Total process time): real time 1.82 seconds cpu time 1.02 seconds 66 67 OPTIONS NONOTES NOSTIMER NOSOURCE NOSYNTAXCHECK; 80 
Change the delete line to this: X= verify(NationalID,"0123456789"); Execute the step and post a few observations from output dataset.
I agree, and G*Power has a lot of articles referencing it for validation so he wouldn't have to worry about it. 
I haven't tried any of these but below are a few links that discuss. One of them writes a temporary VB script to run and create the shortcut. Good luck! https://superuser.com/questions/392061/how-to-make-a-shortcut-from-cmd http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30028709/how-do-i-create-a-shortcut-via-command-line-in-windows
Google search "learning SAS by example data sets". There is a PDF from SAS with instructions and links. If you need the software, create an account and sign up for Programming 1 online through their training section. Its free and comes with a virtual machine that runs SAS for Education (base SAS plus a couple common add-ons and use of Studio)
Thanks! That worked

Proc transpose data=..... ; By group_var_list; Id id_var_list; Var var_list; Run; 
just wondering for the answers it only offers answers to odd numbers at the back of the book are the even number answers available? thanks. 
Hmm, perhaps the figure I quoted is grossly exaggerated.
SAS is not 'like SQL' -- at all...but it does contain a procedure that lets you use SQL directly. I use it every day. I work for big pharma. It's very fast, and really easy to read once you get the hang of it. The nuance is there but after you're familiar with it it's not so bad. SAS was forced on me because of the industry. Our department needs quickly outgrew Excel/Access VBA constraints as more studies came in and that was the route we (I) were forced to go. My job now pays for me to take the SAS certs as I'm able to. I failed the first one once, that was embarrassing...but they were cool about it, I guess a lot of people fail. The tests are riddled with very tricky semantic questions. All that being said, I'd rather use R, and have pushed for it...and do actually use it for certain things...specifically interacting directly with Excel because DDE isn't enabled on our server instances. As others have noted, big corporate doesn't like R because they don't have anyone to place the blame on if something goes catastrophically wrong with the software....SAS is proven reliable and easily validated as such.
A couple of ways: * `of var1-varn` - selects var1, var2, ... , varn regardless of column order * `of var:` - selects all variables whose names begin `var` regardless of column order * `of leftvar--rightvar` - selects all variables between `leftvar` and `rightvar` inclusive based on column order. Fails if `rightvar` is to the left of `leftvar`. * `of myarray[*]` - all elements of the array `myarray` * `of _numeric` - all numeric variables * `of _all_` - all variables 
Can you paste example data? Is there always a number? 
What all is being installed?
Hire SAS to do the job. Best 15k we ever spent 
I believe just base, stat and graph
I don't know what PROC you are using or what you're trying to achieve, but you can use the REFLINE and DROPLINE statements in PROC SGPLOT. You can also create​ annotation data sets to use in a lot of graphics. 
Hi, I'm trying to do something similar to the pic I uploaded. I'm using proc sgplot Thanks for your help, going to try it 
Well if you can't get a hold of it, your best bet is going through the [user guide](https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/emgsj/67981/PDF/default/emgsj.pdf). There is also a decent [YouTube playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVBcK_IpFVi-xzvJiOlf33UvVbRoLRu0z) made by a SAS employee. Chip has been there for like 20 years i believe and really knows his stuff so those videos are well worth watching 
I believe survey responses in SharePoint are stored as list items, you could use within SAS proc http to query the SharePoint REST api to retrieve all the list items.
You wouldn't happen to have an idiots guide to doing this would you? ^_^
Huh, I was about to pull in a bunch of resources but conveniently found this right away: https://www.sas.com/content/dam/SAS/en_ca/User%20Group%20Presentations/Winnipeg-User-Group/HarryDroogendyk-SharepointListData-Fall2012.pdf
Doing the whole thing 15 times? I'd use a macro for that. Just put a proc means after the data step to calculate the mean. You can iterate the whole thing with a macro something like: %do j = 1 %to 15; and then: %end; after the data step and proc means.
You'll probably want to download SAS University Edition (limited, but free): https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html, which includes SAS Studio, and then take a look at some of the official SAS Studio tutorials: http://support.sas.com/training/tutorial/. You do need to have some patience for the installation process, since it requires a virtual machine. There are plenty of unofficial tutorials out there, but I don't really know which are good and which aren't. Do some googling and see whether you prefer text or video tutorials. BUT! Unless you're sure that you need to know SAS, I'd definitely recommend learning R too. It's entirely free, has a booming ecosystem of user-contributed packages, and in my opinion is more flexible than SAS, and does a lot of things much better than SAS that will be helpful in your research, like graphics (http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/index.html) and interactive applications (https://shiny.rstudio.com/).
Thanks! Off the original topic, but as someone in the field of epidemiology, would you say Endnote is an alright citation management software? I got a free download through my university, but haven't messed around on it a lot. 
I think endnote is amazing /the best thing ever, but it's easy to mess up your list of citations with it, by searching for too much. In the search area, I would only search for papers by a specific pmid. So, first on pubmed search and import the one paper with the exact pmid. With the schools VPN you can usually import the paper and download pdf from endnote. It's such a life saver because it'll bring in everything. (Think Google scholar can help do that too.) I first got endnote to manage a bibliography, loved it to manage the pdfs. 
I'm going to forget unless I link it now; But my 2 favorite professors who teach SAS programming + have slides to steal are.... Charles DiMaggio of Columbia U. http://www.columbia.edu/~cjd11/charles_dimaggio/DIRE/ and Mike Zdebof Albany: http://www.albany.edu/~msz03/ I've heard of plenty of stories of mediocre SAS classes, so don't get upset if you get a bad one. Just try and get experience with real data and struggle through it. 
I wouldn't mind getting these as well
Typically you can make SAS output analysis results to a dataset as well as print them, usually using an OUTPUT statement. I haven't checked PROC SCORES, but you can usually do something like: PROC thing; analysis statements; OUTPUT OUT=outlib.myanalysis; RUN; Sometimes you need to specify what gets output, check the SAS manual for the procedure (support.sas.com is pretty good for that stuff).
[ EDIT: I haven't used PROC SCORE with ODS before, and after looking at [this example from SAS](https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63033/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_score_sect017.htm) , it looks like you can just use an OUT= line. Well, what I typed below is still OK advice in general. ] First run your proc with "ods trace" around it: ods trace on; proc whatever data=...; var ...; run; ods trace off; Look at the log, and you'll see something like this: Output Added: ------------- Name: OneWayFreqs Label: One-Way Frequencies Template: Base.Freq.OneWayFreqs Path: Freq.Table1.OneWayFreqs ------------- (There might be multiple tables listed.) What you want is the "Name:" line. Then you can remove the "ods trace" lines, and do this: proc whatever data=...; var ...; ods output OneWayFreqs=my_output_dataset; run; And you'll have an output dataset. BTW, the "ods trace" lines at the beginning only serve to figure out what the table names are called. For a given PROC, these table names are always the same, so with practice you won't need to do this first step anymore (once you've learned what the table names are for a given PROC).
Oh happy days!
https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat480/ Stat481 &amp; stat482. If you're studying during summer might as well study for certification from base SAS and advanced SAS books. Also, look into learning R and Python. You can find these in coursera. Good luck!!
that looks fine to me. If there isn't a specific reason to use the delete you could use output instead. if xyz ge 5 then output;
It's possible you have an empty dataset. What is the source of the dataset?
You can use obs option 
What does the log say? Is xyz a numeric or character variable?
I gave an answer to your subsetting statement to /u/cmwillis02G, however, I realize that your problem may be in proc contents. Can you show your proc contents code?
I do analytics in Auto Finance and we use SAS pretty extensively. I had to more or less learn from scratch, getting some certs/taking classes would be nice because I feel like I do so much learning on the fly and I think learning in a structured environment could be beneficial. I don't really trust any SAS programs I put together from when I first started. 
Legend this will help me alot with a project in work too!
You should really open a support ticket for this one. Did the hostname change? you will need to run the hostname update tool to update all the references in metadata and config files.
Honestly, you'll get a really wide variety of answers on this one! Many of my really experienced colleagues only recently took the exam despite having 10+ years of experience, and that was just because my company wanted them to do so. I on the other hand was fast tracked through a Grad programme, and went from never seeing SAS to passing Base in a little under 4 weeks. YMMV. However I'll speak to the Base exam in that it's tricky because it's designed to test your understanding of how SAS works. It may be multiple choice, but the answers to choose from can often have little things like a misplaced or missing semi-colon, quirks in the way the PDV is being used, etc. I wouldn't say it's *hard* per say, but it absolutely rewards attention to detail and understanding, and punishes misreading. As a bit of guidance, I'd say the fact you've used it already that's a great start, and over a period of time too - but reading through the base materials *will* be necessary to cover all the ins and outs particularly around reading in data with infile, amongst other areas. If you've got the free time to commit, you're probably safe setting a date a month or two away and slowly but surely refining your knowledge rather than trying to cram (plus just setting a date is great motivation). Apologies if that was a bit vague in places, truth is like I said, everyone's different through circumstance so it's hard to say. Good luck for when you do take the exam!
handles multi-GB datasets and has for a long time now. Not Hadoop scaling, but if your utility has an account for everyone in the country and you need to merge that with usage/billing records each month, ... you make up the scenario Big installed corporate base across many industries as others have alluded to. 
I'm not sure about Oracle, but with Teradata, we don't put the username or password in quotes. Have you tried it without?
Do you have an entry in your tnsnames.ora file that has the entry BI=? Are the environment variables set in the sasenv_local file for oracle_home and LD Library Path? 
A possible solution would be to try and remove everything you don't want rather than extract. Try this: distance = prxchange("s/(drove|traveled|went|miles+) //i", - 1,orig_var); Edit: figured out how to extract from a regular expression. PRXPOSN pattern = prxparse("(went|drove|traveled)\s(\w+-*\w*)\s(mile\d*)/i"); distance = prxposn(pattern,2,orig_var); Not really sure if one is more efficient than the other but I've tested both of them on the examples you've given above and they work

I used this dataset in my Data Mining course at Uni: https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit Also, if you want to get into Credit Scoring look into getting this book: https://www.amazon.com/Credit-Risk-Scorecards-Implementing-Intelligent/dp/047175451X Everyone I know who are into Credit Scoring either learned from this book or from a mentor who learned from this book. Hope those help.
Thank you! I have been researching how necessary SAS/ACCESS is before I read this reply and I found that there was a way to point SAS to the test file for Hive, but this would not maintain any schema or model that we have on the data. Does SAS/ACCESS maintain the schema/model, or is it only able to see the raw data (AKA can it see keyed data, or just raw) Thanks again, this was super helpful!
Thank you! This cleared up a few questions!
No problem! Any other questions, just fire away. I used to work for SAS and help companies get set up using SAS and Hadoop, and I really do think that's it's a great fit for companies moving into Big Data, especially for the minimized data movement. 
I'd say that for most people, base is actually more difficult. This is because most people find data step processing much less intuitive than SQL.
Perhaps you could stop talking down to long-time SAS programmers, as many SAS employees like to do. On our company's SAS install (administered by SAS, by the way), there is no interface on the server. The SAS Windowing interface is not installed. So we have no choice but to use a text editor on the server.
The windowing interface should be there but buried. In our server installs you can manage to load it from sasconfig/Lev1/SASApp/sas.sh will launch it, as well as sashome/SASFoundation/9.4/sas You just need to have a client with x11 ready to go (mobaxterm is the easiest method)
I actually write most of my code in atom, using the sas language plugin. its nice to have the directory tree on the side and a fast and snappy IDE. 
We have a Grid installation, so those locations aren't quite the same from what I can tell. There is a Lev1/Applications/, but there is no sas.sh or anything similar. There is no SASFoundation directory at all from what I can see.
Interesting, how do you run code against the grid? edit a text file and run a command? can you use Enterprise Guide?
Code/Macro?
Did you even click the link? It's in the article.
Not in front of sas right now but I'm pretty sure you can just add the word DESCENDING right before the raxis statement 
I agree. I've asked around to professors and such and they usually say that if you are fluent with SAS an employer or academic institution who uses R will be willing to take you on. The learning curve won't be too steep. I'm most familiar with SAS but I think it's good practice to understand basic syntax in SAS, R, Tableau, Remi, Stata, and the like. Not only good practice but good for a resume too. There are advantages and disadvantages to all of them. I.e. SAS will run code from 50 years ago while open source R won't necessarily without the right packages. But the open source and customizable packages is part of what makes R good for some people. So it is a lot of preference. Of course if you go work for a company who pays for SAS licensing you won't have much choice probably. I'm about to enter a graduate program where I'll get experience with a lot of different statistical packages, I've been wondering if the certification is worth it as well. It can't hurt to get the SAS base programmer certification I don't think of course. 
I use big data sets :/ plus eventually I will use other packages
How big are your datasets? I've been able to run datasets with 40+ variables and 80,000+ entries just fine on SASU.
One thing to keep in mind is that after you graduate, you'll probably be logging in to your company network when you use SAS. So beyond graduate school, there probably won't be a need to have SAS installed on your personal machine.
Meaning no disrespect, but in healthcare that is an incredibly small input dataset. You're looking at millions to hundreds of millions of rows for claims data.
Hey fellow epi student! Also in grad school for my MPH. I currently have a Lenovo Thinkpad T420, and it's alright. I run STATA and SAS on it and it's a nice little machine. Word of warning though: SAS is a bitch to install (at least from my universitys software portal). I tried downloading the program 10 plus times onto my newer desktop and it just did not like for some reason.
Where &lt;variable&gt; is not missing;
To answer my own question, the trick was to not output results to work library.

You should check out http://boemskats.com/esm/ :)
Yep, this should do it
 data delivery_dtl; merge quick (IN=IN1) slow (IN=IN2) veryslow (IN=IN3); by Order_ID; drop Employee_ID; LENGTH delivery_speed $10; IF IN1 THEN delivery_speed="Quick"; ELSE IF IN2 THEN delivery_speed = "Slow"; ELSE delivery_speed = "Very slow"; run;
This is the page I looked at to get rid of the commas. I tried this numeric_var = input(char_var,comma10.); (in context) and it got rid of the comma but still had it recorded as a character variable.
In addition to the if-then statements, proc format is another option.
thanks! got it working perfectly!
I actually fixed this issue using a proc sql command. proc sql; create table &lt;new&gt; ( ColumnName Numeric, ColumnName2 Varchar, YouGetThePoint Integer ) insert into new select * from old Something along these lines should get you where you want to be. If you need more direction just lmk

Perfect answer.
Congrats man! Now get to crackin on the advanced cert.
It's a rough exam. Congrats!
Although they are outnumbered by the R / Python users, there are many SAS users on stackoverflow, who are capable and willing to answer practically any SAS-related question, provided that you: * Demonstrate that you've made an attempt to answer your own question. * Provide a reproducible example of the problem you're having, including dummy datasets where applicable. Some of the more technical questions end up being referred to https://communities.sas.com 
you could try this- proc sort data=dataset1; by id; Run; proc sort data=dataset2; by id; Run; Data Final; merge dataset1 dataset2; by id; Run; [Here is a really good SAS paper on the topic](http://www.lexjansen.com/nesug/nesug11/ds/ds03.pdf) 
Cheers!!!!
Congratulations!! Get advance asap. 👍
Grab a newer version if you arent a fan of the flash apps. It looks like everything is now html/javascript. You may be able to do some ETL stuff in visual data builder but DI studio has a lot of advanced ETL features that you find in the VA apps. Also EG is where many people work and write code that may not have access to advanced apps or want to design their projects at a granular level. Everyone's projects are slightly different and require tooling to best suit their needs.
Perhaps try something like this ... numeric_var=.; numeric_var = input(char_var,comma10.);
DI studio is good at creating ETL jobs that are registered in SAS metadata, think how you generate data for production reports, not ad-hoc analytics. EG is how you run SAS code on the system, you can do MUCH MUCH more in EG than you can do in VA, but VA is MUCH better at doing what it can do than eg is. There are more specific use cases where EG or VA or DI studio (or the add-in for Microsoft Office) are best used however that requires a bit more information about what you are trying to accomplish and with what data. 
All I really wanted to do is use VA to manage uploading of data into tables. But the way in memory LASR works is it needs files on the server to reload every time. The VA ad hoc loader via the web interface does not copy any files across, therefore if the server resets then that data is lost. It seems the only way to get data into the system in a way that is persistent is to use FTP and have a whole bunch of files sitting on a server. 
Will look into Public Data Provider library My understanding is that autoload takes a pile of csv files (every file you have ever decided to upload to the database) on the server and then reloads them all back into tables. Is that true? That seems rather clunky to me. Could my misunderstanding be that LASR then not really a 'database' in the sense that it is a place to save all your data? Is it just a place required for a fast way to do visualisations and that i should have storage somewhere else (csv, hadoop, postgres)?
Thanks for explaining. Starting to make sense now.
Do you have time series stuff in Enterprise Guide? Tasks-&gt;Time Series
I Love You. Started working in a job where I have to use SAS. Studied mathematics and had the chance to get a cerificstion at uni but did not wanr to pay the fee. I thought im not going to need it because everything i want to analyse i would use c++ and python for. then i was confronted with the reality and find it hard to get access to good free introductions to sas ( still have to write my master thesis in maths, but started an internship nonetheless, so i was able to download the university edition ) and i judt found your blog. Nice!!!
Proc Gproject is your friend! :)
The "clear" just disassociates the existing librefs. It doesn't delete the files. Details are here: http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lestmtsref/69738/HTML/default/viewer.htm#p05r9vhhqbhfzun1qo9mw64s4700.htm. I don't know of a way to have SAS overwrite the existing files. I have always issued OS commands to do that. You could try using SAS "x" commands. Here is more information: http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/hostwin/63285/HTML/default/viewer.htm#win-stmt-x.htm.
I used to work Presales for SAS, though I didn't go through the academy but was instead a direct hire. There's a few routes you can go, some of which are more technical than others. I was a Systems Engineer, which called for a broad understanding of SAS technologies and capabilities, including expertise on a few core principles (SAS &amp; Hadoop, SAS Grid, In-Memory Analytics, etc). SEs are responsible for presenting/demonstrating the tools but also working directly with the account executives to uncover business issues that the client is trying to solve for and to present a solution. Technical Architects have a much deeper knowledge base and are technical experts. They rarely have to know how to use the tools at all, and more have to understand the admin/platform side of it. On the other end of the spectrum, you'll get Industry Consultants that are knowledgeable about how to use SAS specifically to solve industry-related problems. For example, deep knowledge in how to use SAS Episode Analytics for the Health and Life Science industry. As far as the interview itself, it kind of depends on your background and where you'd fit into the spectrum of demonstrating products to understanding all of the technical side. My interview focused on my experience using SAS, how I felt it stacked up to the other tools in the BI landscape, and your traditional behavioral questions in round 1. Second round of interviews was focused on questioning my experience in presenting and demonstrating software/tools/analysis. Third round was actually presenting to a panel of SAS employees for 45 minutes, just like they were a potential customer. My friend was in the Sales Academy, and they had a ton of support throughout the whole academy, and even more so beyond. I don't know anyone that went through presales academy, but I have to imagine it'll be similar support system. 
Thanks for such a great description! Btw I'm from a computer science background. Presales has both of a tech and nontech domain it seems, so they might be interviewing me on a tech basis. 
Unfortunately I can't use "x" command because I am using SAS Enterprise Guide as client, and the shell access on this server is disabled. I can add my map folder as a SAS library, but then is there an alternative to "x", or PROC DATASET for deleting arbitrary files that are not datasets? 
Yes, use the [fdelete](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrdict/64316/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a000245893.htm) function. You can iterate through the folder to list and delete each file using the dopen / dnum / dread functions.
Thanks for the info, do you know a way to solve my problem in any other way?
Solution found here: http://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings09/055-2009.pdf Thanks
Just had to clear the CMOS =)
Clearing CMOS fixed the monitor issue. Now I just have to make sure my hardware settings are correct the next install!
no it isn't. ive only seen it blocked once.
the base and advanced certification exams test your knowledge of the USER GUIDE material. Get the test content list from sas.com, then study the user guide content for those topics.
I've worked it out. For those who look for a similar answer later you can ask for the following option in a proc mixed statement. Model /outpredm =datasetname This dataset will have the following values: Pred : A fitted value for that group Upper: Upper CI Lower: Lower CI Hope it helps someone else out there!
You must be connecting to environments without SAS Integration Technologies. Most environments that allow users to submit SAS code to a server from their machine via enterprise guide or SAS Studio do have this enforced, which admittedly are most SAS environments I touch. 
This is down to a seemingly unrelated bit of behaviour that is specified in the documentation: &gt; When you specify DSD, SAS treats two consecutive delimiters as a missing value An equivalent way of interpreting this is: &gt; When you specify DSD, SAS stops reading in characters as soon as it reaches a delimiter After reading in `str2` the input pointer is right on top of a delimiter, but it has not been read yet. With `dsd` enabled, SAS starts reading characters, sees a delimiter immediately, and assumes that it has reached the end of the next variable that you were trying to input, just as if it had read in two consecutive delimiters, so it outputs a missing value. When `dsd` is not enabled, SAS skips the delimiter and starts reading from the next character. If you use `:$11.` to input `str2` combined with `dsd`, the `:` format modifier overrides this quirk of the behaviour of `dsd`, as this tells SAS that everything up to the next comma is part of `str2`.
Can confirm. I worked for a large bank in the UK for 3 years and I moved to another large bank a month ago so I have a sense of perspective on this. There are entire departments that revolve around SAS. Risk functions in banks are very likely to have analysts who drive insight from data, and of course you need SAS developers to create that data from source. The introduction of new tools like DI, E.G., the SAS add-in and VA are keeping things fresh, and the split between Analyst and developer is widening. I can go into more detail if anyone wants, but the long and short is that SAS is here to stay and it's evolving as business needs grow. I can't see myself being out of a job for a while. 
PROC GLM data=stuff; Class group; Model month7loss = weightloss group /ss3; Run; There's an example of 2 way anova ancova. In my class variable I have inventive and control. In my data step I specified incntv = (group ='incentive'); to give SAS my reference point. Edit: option ss3 just give you ss3 sum of squares. You can also use the option solution and I think that gives you the additive model. 
I don't exactly know that terminology but I was looking it up and it seems like your talking bout your anova having 3 different conditions instead of 2 like I had in my example. So it should work you will just be analyzing the conditions among three different points. For example an experiment where you measure something before, during, and after a certain condition. But I am also seeing the assumptions about repeated measured anovas so you should look into that to make sure your data conform to the model assumptions. If you google repeated measure anova there's a good article from statistics.laerd.com. So in summary I don't think your syntax has to be different but your "condition" variable will just have 3 different conditions. Edit: but I'm not an expert I have a pretty limited bit of modeling experience with anova. Good luck!! Edit 2: also if you are trying to compare means between 10 different conditions it should work but you should of course have plenty (a lot) of data at each time point to do it. 
I'd say don't hesitate to mess around in the SAS settings. You can always install again if it messes anything up.
What's the path to your base sas.exe? what's the value in SASHOME\SASFoundation\9.4\sasv9.cfg? look specifically for nls\en 
u could learn japanese if u have the time
the file just contains this: -config "C:\Program Files\SASHome\SASFoundation\9.4\nls\en\sasv9.cfg"
Hehe, I'll put that one in the hopper.
Nope
Nawh 
Great, thanks!
I used the same colors as the original graph, by using the 'Pixeur' tool to sample the color on the screen, and tell me what the RGB code was. Where I used 'ods html', you could use 'ods html5' instead (assuming you have a fairly current version of SAS). Here's a blog with an example of html5: http://blogs.sas.com/content/sastraining/2013/11/06/sas-9-4-has-a-new-way-to-send-interactive-graphs-in-email/ 
Look at how to use variables with patterned names like D1 D2 D3 D4.. you can specify a range (consecutive) D1-D4 in your var statement in proc means. You can also use the colon wildcard, as in.. var d: Proc means is great for column statistics like what you want. Example.. on mobile, so... Formatting might be terrible... Proc means data=have nway; Var AnsQ: ; Out=want (drop=_:) mean= ; Run; Uses the colon to specfiy the variables and to trim out the automatically generated columns by proc means. Try Google or the SAS community for stuff... There is someone who was usually asked before you and some of the white papers are pure gold for weird or very specific tasks. Good luck! 
Have you tried checking the SAS/STAT User's Guide? https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63347/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_glimmix_sect031.htm
Average response doesn't make sense to me in this context. What you're dealing with are categorical variables in some sense. If you think about it, averages only make sense when the underlying numbers have intrinsic value. In this case, they don't. My sense here is that you want to do some sort of categorical analysis. Look into the frequency and tabulate procedures to get a sense of how many students provided each answer for a given question. If you want to do statistical analysis, you could do something like compare the distribution of answers among various subsets of students (male vs female is a common example; depending on your data, this kind of deeper statistical dive may or may not be feasible). 
The top part is setting up his password and bottom part is directly tunneling into the server to do stuff. (I can add more details later if ya need). Like hard code your password in and get moving. 
im confused about the date block of code, starting at the strip section not the connection
You probably want to edit this code even further. Companies would probably rather not have database names or links published to an unsecure site like Reddit. Even if it's pretty useless, it's probably better to protect yourself so you don't run into trouble. As to your question on the dates, I think you need to also figure out what the macro %GETDATES is doing. It doesn't look like a standardized SAS macro to me. My assumption based on the code you've posted is that %GETDATES parses the value (1/1/2016 in the code above) into MM, DD, and YYYY components. Then the string turns those numeric values into a text string which looks like 2016-01-01. Same thing for datestring1, only it creates the string 2016-04-15. To summarize: 1. Edit the code to get rid of table names/connection info from the PROC SQL statement. Your company probably doesn't want that information floating out on the web. 2. Figure out what %GETDATES is doing. 
Try posting to the jmp Communities - lots of engineers there that could help with this! https://community.jmp.com/ Also, the jmp Learning Library may provide some resources of interest: https://www.jmp.com/en_us/learning-library.html
thank you very much!
I believe you are looking for [proc compare](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/proc/65145/HTML/default/viewer.htm#n0c1y14wyd3u7yn1dmfcpaejllsn.htm) with an appropriate `by` statement and output dataset.
Thank you! I believe that will do the trick. Proc compare data=set1 compare=set2 output=want; ID=CustomerID; run; this gives me a great overview, however, I am not sure about the output. It adds the rows _TYPE_ with value "DIF" as well as _OBS_ = 1 to N. The values that are equal er marked with "." and "...". I am not sure how to interpret the output dataset basically. Can you advise? Thanks again
Make sure to post that this is 1)paid, 2) has already elapsed and 3) appears to only go through essentials and data manipulation.
wellll I solved it. Needed a %sysfunc() around the %let number_months = %sysfunc(intck('MONTH',&amp;start_month,&amp;end_month)); This sub could use some activity like /r/excel
Yeah, we have like 1/30th the readers of /r/excel. I would assume a lot less people use SAS than Excel.
SAS Communities is also a good resource for posting programming/content related questions you might have: https://communities.sas.com/
As far as I know, your users don't all need their own license. They're not installing it on their own machines, but rather, hitting the server where the software is installed.
The college students are mostly on break now, so we haven't gotten as many requests to help with homework assignments lately. It is good to see all the younger people learning SAS, though.
Just what we need -- one more thing to *keep* us from doing our jobs due to overzealous admins.
you absolutely can distribute SAS VA reports created in designer. you can also set up a schedule to have them automatically distributed. You can email users PDF copies of reports, or email them links to the reports in VA. They don't need their own license, just permission.
no mention of stored process or OLAP cube studio...these are topics on this exam so your course sucks.
SAS is the industry standard in biotech.
I thought the base exam was harder, personally, because I never use a lot of the functionality they cover in that test. I spend most of my time writing crazy macros, proc sql, advanced data step stuff...so the content of the advanced exam was easier for me. then again, I have a lot of experience with SAS, and didn't get certifications to try an enter the industry.
I've never made this move but I can tell what it will be like. It will be heaven. Most of the SAS jobs in biotch ate remote....you know, work from home. Roll out of bed and login. no commute. no business casual attire. no cubicles. no burnt popcorn. no traffic. 
I've gotten a lot of mileage out of PROC SURVEYSELECT for bootstrap estimates: http://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2016/08/10/bootstrap-confidence-interval-sas.html 
You've already answered your own question - use a do-loop and possibly an array or two.
I researched and tried to figure and write what function could help me but I can't figure out how to write the function. 
I'm not sure what this data represents. Is it historical to show the date when an account hit 30, 60, 90, etc.? What does "start_dt" represent. Understanding the data a little more might help in simplifying it. Also, using 'day' with intck is just subtracting one number from the other, so that could also help simplify. It's also confusing how "bad30" is taking a value of 1 if it's LE 30, 60, 90, and 120. How does that differentiate the various values?
Yes, you would need the SAS access engine for your specific DB or ODBC 
http://support.sas.com/software/products/odbc/
Same? :3
never heard anything back from him :/
You can also use SAS itself as a database - you can do all of those things to SAS datasets themselves.
Does this mean that a user does not have to be a power user in order to make changes/updates? They can complete this via SAS VA on the web?
I know it's possible to trigger a SAS stored procedure via the web and that can execute arbitrary SAS code. However I haven't used this functionality myself. 
Have you tried creating a dummy variable? Maybe something funky going on with that? Or try proc surveyglm? (Not sure if that exists )
Or is the variable in your class statement 
What's the full command that you're using? I suspect there's something funny with the way SAS is coding the dummy, or its accidentally being treated as a continuous.
I managed to resolve the issue. It had nothing to do with the class statement - all was correctly specified. Therefore no continuous variables nor dummy variables were in the model. The log provided neither warning nor error, but the output gave the following: &gt; "Note: 1 response level was deleted due to missing or invalid values for its explanatory, frequency, weight, strata, or cluster variables." So the problem was too many variables in my preliminary model (16 covariates with many of them 3-5 levels). Solution was to use a more stringent alpha criterion for entry into the model..
your code doesn't make much sense. The first 4 conditions are always true, if the last one is true and I can't see why you're using four of them while losing the information since the result is always written to the same *bad30* variable. Same goes for the second block. Just think a little bit differently on a step to step basis. First derive the variables daystoxx. Take a look at the results. Derive new variables.
The Keyboard Macros window might be offscreen -- can happen if you sometimes use multiple displays. When it "freezes", press Alt+SPACEBAR, then M, to activate "move window" -- use the arrow keys to move the window until it appears on your screen.
Perfect and simple. Thank you. -.-
Are you trying to do this just for this one particular sort of event? Please post an example of what you want the dataset to look like before and after you've applied your intended logic.
ID|Events|Policy No.| :--|:--|:--|:--| 1|208|123456| 1|207|| 1|207|| 1|207|| 1|213|123456| 1|214|| 1|215|| 2|208|234567| 2|207|| 2|207|| 2|213|234567| 2|214|| 2|215|| This is the before/current state
ID|Events|Policy No.| :--|:--|:--|:--| 1|208|123456| 1|207|123456| 1|207|123456| 1|207|123456| 1|213|123456| 1|214|| 1|215|| 2|208|234567| 2|207|234567| 2|207|234567| 2|213|234567| 2|214|| 2|215|| This is desired/after state
I want to fill in Policy number for all event = 207 with the same Policy number as event=208
You can do this in several ways. First that comes to mind: Create table new as Select id, policy from table where events=208 Then do a left join to the initial table and do coalecec(old.policy, new.policy) as policy
Assuming your data always follows this pattern where an event like 208 (or something else with the same Policy No.) precedes the event where you need to fill in the missing values, something like this should work: data work.testoutput; set work.testinput; /*set to the dataset the data is currently in*/ if PolicyNo ^= . then PolicyHold=PolicyNo; /*hold the policy number in a temp variable when it's not missing*/ retain PolicyHold; /*keep our temp variable in the input buffer between iterations*/ if Events = 207 and PolicyNo = . then PolicyNo = PolicyHold; /*when the event is 207, reassign the PolicyNo back to it from the retained temp var*/ drop PolicyHold; /*don't output our temp variable*/ run; Swap `.` with `' '` if they're character variables. 
I'm trying to teach myself SAS too, they have a lot of free online videos and a free course online.
You can find a number of free resources to learn SAS via myschoolbucks.com/ver2/login/getmain?requestAction=home. Click here for info on Academic Programs https://www.sas.com/en_us/learn/academic-programs.html and for programming/content related questions, the SAS Community has a wealth of information on usage https://communities.sas.com/t5/Learn-SAS/ct-p/learn I hope this helps!
SAS 1 is free online though their website and gets you a copy of SAS Studio educational edition so you can experiment on your own. If you like SAS 1, find a local tech school/adult learning center that is offering them in a nearby city. You'll probably save thousands on just the coursework. Certification is separate, and also costs money. IMHO, get the certificate if you want it, sufficient common sense and a steady knowledge of SAS can open doors, especially in insurance, medical, or banking even without a certificate. Good luck and come back with questions!

Yes, it's very annoying, and yes, you can turn it off. I'm not in front of my computer right now, but there's an options menu that lets you turn off that and several of the other annoying content-sensitive features. 
Oh! Please fill me in when you get a minute! 
Tools -&gt; Options and then click "SAS Programs" on the left menu. Click "Editor Options" button at the top. Click "Autocomplete" tab and uncheck "Enable Autocomplete." Click "Ok" twice, and you should be good. Might also browse the other tabs to alleviate other annoyances.
In SAS Studio? I only have preferences. 
Those instructions are for SAS EG. Hopefully there's something similar there somewhere. I found this online: I believe that at this time the only options related to the autocomplete feature and syntax help are the ones found in the Preferences window (click the More application options button &gt; Preferences &gt; Editor): Enable autocomplete - turns the entire autocomplete feature on or off (syntax and documentation)
In preferences, on the left there's general, start up, editor, results, tasks, repositories, background jobs, SAS enterprise guide integration.

Below topics are covered in the syllabus of SAS. This course is divided into two modules. Module 1 - Base SAS • Data Structures • Data Management • Report Generation Module 2 - Advanced SAS • Proc SQL • SAS Macros • Case Studies You will find more details information here http://cliplab.co.in/clinical-sas-programming-training/
PROC LTA (and LCA) are not built-in SAS procs -- they are [documented and available for download here](https://methodology.psu.edu/downloads/proclcalta). I cross posted your question to the [Stat Procs board of SAS Support Communities](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Statistical-Procedures/Questions-about-PROC-LTA/m-p/385503#M20037). You can follow the conversation there -- if there are follow-up questions you might want to join in. 
[There's this tool from SAS](http://support.sas.com/kb/44/852.html), but I've never used it.
Thanks, I'd rather just is keys though. 
Is carcost1-6 in six difference columns? or does each one have a different row with a person identifier repeated? If the first one, you could have a bunch of case statements. If the latter, you can just do a proc sql average(carcost) and it'll auto compensate for the amount of rows
Just doing a simple carcostmean = mean(of carcost01 - carcost06); should work fine. It will only calculate for populated variables and divide by the number of populated values.
Each of the carcost is in different columns. 
Will go ahead and give this a try, thanks!
I would manipulate the dataset so that you have only two variables - Transaction and PayMethod. Then you just need a proc means with a class statement. Make six datasets each with a pair of variables, rename variables, and stack them together into one tall dataset. If you have a lot more than 6, that's where you might need some fancy macro or array coding. 
 DATA myTR; * Assuming some sort of TR_ID already exists; SET oldTR (KEEP=TR_ID TR_amount TR_method); TR_amount = TR01; TR_method = TR01Pay; OUTPUT; TR_amount = TR02; TR_method = TR02Pay; OUTPUT; TR_amount = TR03; TR_method = TR03Pay; OUTPUT; * ... repeat 6 times ... could be done nicely with arrays; RUN; PROC MEANS DATA=myTR; CLASS TR_method; VAR TR_amount; RUN; 
I'm going to give this a try, thanks so much!
I seem to have self-solved: putting options nonotes; after the rsubmit; seem to do it.
I know you already have a solution, but PROC PRINTTO should be mentioned: proc printto log='C:\wherever\mylogfile.txt'; run; This re-routes the log to a text file. The actual log window doesn't get any more text after this statement.
You might also try `option nosource nosource2 nomprint;` if you really want to cut down on log output, but bear in mind that this will make your code much harder to debug.
Age is categorical, and it is possible for the same person to have more than one Dx value. The data set I want would not have name at all.
Proc FREQ data=...; tables Dx * Age * Sex / out=... nopercent norow nocol; run; Yes, you can do the same with Tabulate. You can figure it out in SAS doc through a google search. Are you a student?
If you want to have every combination even when your data does not have every combination represented, you can build an empty data set with all combinations. You can output a data set on your original data from PROC FREQ or PROC TABULATE. Then merge to the empty data set and set the missing values for COUNT (if you use PROC FREQ) to 0. Then you can use PROC TABULATE or even PROC PRINT to display your results.
Something I just thought of, I can always just make a random sample of the customer id of course. My slow sas way would be to merge this to the complete 1million customer*365 day file using a flag then deleting if the customer id isn't in the larger file. But is there any way to do this more efficiently?
It's a pain, but I would proc transpose each variable, then do a merge at the end 
If you want to see it in ods I'd use the list option. My overall method would be to use sql and groyp by everything android count distinct names, assuming they are unique. 
I believe ordering by rand(), and then limiting to the number you want is the way to go. So something like: proc sql; connect to odbc(datasrc="zzzzz" user=xxxxx password=yyyy); create table &amp;dsn as select * from connection to odbc (SELECT A.Var as "Var" A.DateVar as "Date", B.othervar as "OVar", From lib.var A, olib.ovar B Where A.Var = B.OtherVar AND A.Date BETWEEN ("1-Jan-2006" AND "31-Dec-2006") Group by A.Var, B.OtherVar Order by Rand () Limit 2500 ; ) ; disconnect from odbc; quit; See here for more info: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/580639/how-to-randomly-select-rows-in-sql
There are feature in proc tabulate that I believewould allow you to do this fairly easily. Something along the lines of the code below, perhapts with a "/printmiss" in the table statement combined with some format. At a minimum you could merge the resulting ODS dataset "whatIwant" with a dataset containing all possible combos and set the var "N" to 0 if missing. ods output Table = whatIwant; proc tabulate missing; class dx age sex; table dx*age*sex, n; run; ods quit; PROC SQL would be another possibility...
I appreciate this, and I figured out how to do something similar, the problem is that it doesn't include all the dates. For instance, let's say there are 100 customers and for each customer there are 10 dates (so 1000 obs). What I was hoping to do is pick randomly, 20 customers each with all 10 dates. I managed to do it by picking the 20 customers first (at only one date) then pulling all 1000 obs and only keeping those aligned with the 20 customers giving me 200 obs. (in actuality it was 1.1M customers and 366 dates so quite a bit bigger of course). Just going forward it'd be nice to find a way to do it all quicker through sql on the server. 
I'm not sure I follow what you're trying to do. You want to pick random customers, but then all dates associated with the selected customers? 
exactly
I'm about to leave the office, but you can do it all in SQL with a subsetting query. Basically, do a Select b.* ,sum (whatever) as sum from (select name From table Order by rand () Limit 100) as a left join Table as b On a.name=b.name ; If that doesn't work, it's something close. Sorry, gotta jet. 
You rock, thank you. Will try tonight!
I doubt there's a DM key for find, but can't you submit a program from dmkeys? My old coworker used to have a log checking program to bulk check like 20 logs, that seems the simplest solution. There are tons of log checking programs you could steal onlone, then just run it from a DMkey. The "proper" way of doing this is probably using return codes, which is probably a lot more coding, but I'm sure more robust. Good luck.
Do you HAVE to do it one PROC SQL? I mean this is EXACTLY what PROC SURVEYSELECT was designed to do [with the strata option]. Of course, it does depend if you want to drag all the records in first, but a daily snap of a million records a day is not all that big. It might be faster depending on the iron behind it that playing around with sub queries.
Yes, it looks like PRINTMISS should work, maybe along with "MISSTEXT='0'". Those are both new to me. Thanks for passing them along!
Are you able to access the sas7bdat files in SAS University Edition? What code have you tried?
As far as I'm aware, you always need to load existing datasets into SAS VA.
You can't run SAS commands, you have to use the built in import options for CSV, Excel and such (if you have authority) or have an admin copy a SAS file to the LASR library.
If you know the syntax for the procedures you mentioned, there are some pretty obvious clues in your post which suggest which one is the one you're looking for. In other words, you're basically describing the output to PROC REPORT.
Yes, I agree. Proc report is the best choice. That wouldn't be possible at all with summary, and it would require a lot of pre-processing with tabulate.
So that's not working? What does it say in the log?
Oh, get rid of the extension. Just use "data = abc".
Are you specifying the full path where you want the file? Does it say the file was written in the SAS log?
Can you paste the log here? Edit: Also, no quotes around the data set name.
Get rid of the semicolon after data1.
The fatal error is that there is not a temporary data set named data1. Is it actually a permanent data set? If so, you need a two-level name, like mydir.data1, where mydir is the libname that you have assigned. There's no reason for the data main step at all, as you're not doing anything with the main data set. Also, it should just be setting a data set, like "set data1;" -- not specifying a file location. If the data set is located there, you need the libname and two-level name to reference it.
 libname mylib "/folders/myfolders/"; run; PROC EXPORT Data = mylib.data1 FILE = "/folders/myfolders/abc.csv" DBMS = CSV REPLACE; RUN; My assumption is that you have a file called data1.sas7bdat in the directory /folders/myfolders/. If the file name or directory path differs, adjust accordingly. If, however, data1 is a temporary data set, omit the "mylib." from the proc export.
Just keep learning SAS and try to help others. You're welcome. Glad it worked!
Is your end goal to create a Boolean indicator? Would the 30, 60 dates be filled if the accounts hit said delinquencies? Will the dates be cleared once payment received? Then something like this might work. Bad30=not(missing(day30_dt)); Bad60=not(missing(day60_dt));
Couple of days late to the party but just to throw my 2 cents in and to help you along with future coding - Arrays wouldn't work for the TRxxPAY columns as they need to have a numerical suffix. Macros will. Using the solution from neoporcupine: %macro do_things; %do i = 1 %to 6; %let suffix=%sysfunc(putn(&amp;i,z2.)); TR_AMOUNT = TR&amp;suffix.; TR_METHOD = TR&amp;suffix.PAY; output; %end; %mend do_things; data myTR (KEEP=TR_ID TR_amount TR_method); set OLDTR; %do_things; run;
I did not know this - thanks! A trick I use a lot: Knowing that macro variables resolve to code, you can use dictionary tables and the INTO assignment method to generate code for you on the fly. So, suppose you wanted to generate a proc tabulate for every categorical variable in a dataset: Proc sql noprint; Select Name ,'TABLE ' || NAME || ', variable*mean;' Into :list separated by ' ',:tables separated by ' ' From dictionary.columns where libname='libname' and [whatever the field for table name is] = 'TABLE name'; Quit; Proc tabulate data=table name; Class &amp;list.; Var variable; &amp;Tables. Run; What may have take 2000 lines of code has now been knocked down to less than 20. Prolly messed up above somewhere - typing on mobile.
For really long programs I like to use cntrl + f2, which creates a temporary marker in your code. If you scroll away and then hit f2 again you'll be brought back to your marker.
This is a silly one, but if I have a bunch of code I want to comment out that itself has /* */ comments in it, I just do this: %macro junk; (code I want to omit) %mend; And just never call %junk at all.
I've done this! Usually I call it %nope
Br careful with this, assigning a variable in this way (value + 1;) implies a retain statement. This can be very useful but can also give the wrong result if not understood correctly.
To make a zero/one variable based on a condition without if/else: MyVarAdults = (age &gt;= 18) ; 
Ctrl +alt+delete. 
When I tested it, I threw a single "x+3;" into my data step (where x had not been previously defined at all), and sure enough, the records of x went 3, 6, 9, 12, etc. I suppose there are ways to misuse it, but I think it makes sense the way it is to me...
I *always* do this. Good tip though, I know a lot of people who don't! 
Looks like you did a set instead of merge...
Good grief. I've been using SAS for years and always learn something new.
well give merge another try in case this is true lol, it is possible ha
no go :/ it is truncating the data...
If you did get that result with a merge, there's some difference between the value in x in the two data sets. Maybe special characters or something that's unprintable?
Proc sql; Create table anon as select distinct name from dataset; quit; Data anon; Set anon; Id = \_N\_; Run; Now just join the anon table to the original table, replacing name with ID.
Thanks! I'll try that in a few minutes and let you know what my results are.
This generates an ID table that I can merge, which is fantastic and close, but how do I make it "Item_N_"? 
 proc sort data = mydata; by purchaser; run; data newdata; set mydata; by purchaser; if first.purchaser then purch_ctr + 1; anon_purchaser = "Customer"||put(purch_ctr, z5.); run; Then just do the same with the items.
Yes! Thanks for this!
a few favourites of mine 1)Move arbitrary date to its month end position Month end=intnx("month", arbitarydate,0,"e"); 2) single and double dash shorthand when referring to groups of variable If you have variables a1, a2, a3, a4 ... a100 you can refer to them as a1-a100 E.g. Data xxx(drop=a1-a100); If your variables are ordered like this (a,b,c to z) you can refer to them as a--z E.g data xxx(drop=a--z);
Along the lines of #2, some folks aren't aware of the colon wildcard syntax, e.g. array alltimevars(*) time:; automatically grabs every variable whose name starts with "time". Or... sumtime = sum(of time:); 
Paste the code you're using.
You're welcome!
Id_char = 'item ' || put(I'd,8.); But why would you want to do that? It will take more space to store, more processing for comparisons, and will add no additional information. That sounds dumb.
PROC FCMP - too much to list in a post, but it can revolutionise your code. Want to call SQL on a 'set' statement, sure. Want to run a macro which counts the # records in a text file, based on a variable within a datastep, no problem. Google 'macro function sandwich'.
Simple one... if you work with remote sessions, simply setting CTRL-F3 or ALT-F3 to 'rsubmit' saves you embedding rsubmit/endrusbmit lines in your code. Plus if you then batch up that code in the remote environment, there's no chance of rsubmitting an rsubmit!
The link to xml with syntax on github was great, thank you! I have encountered some other version, but it was quite poor in quality.
Why would I do this? There are no benefits discussed in the article.
Wow, this is pretty cool. Thanks for the heads up
Necessity. I just started a new job where this is required and it fucking sucks. The company won't pay for the enhanced editor, so this is an only option. Thankful for OP writing it up.
They have SAS licenses but not for the editor? I've never heard of such a thing. You don't mean no enterprise guide, but no base SAS editor?
You read that right. Licenses for the SAS engine, no enhanced editor. I'm not referring to Enterprise guide. They don't have PC SAS either. Just the Unix one. And God help you if you aren't a fanatic for emacs.
I worked in a place that didn't have EG and the SAS Studio webserver was constantly have issues. I used Sublime Text (with a SAS syntax highlighting package) and Putty to do all my development. Definitely not as good as using EG or a stable SAS Studio environment. The biggest downfall was not being able to run code interactively. IMO keep to the SAS designed tools if you have the option.
Well this seems pretty useful then. Man, and I thought switching to EG from base SAS was a chore. That sounds awful.
that hurts my brain. what kind of firm is it? public/private health/business?
Saving for later
This is straightforward with tabulate: proc tabulate data= yourData; class classroom; var country region state county; table classroom='Classroom', (country='US' region='West Coast' state='California' county='LA' ) * (sum='#' mean='%'); run; 
It is. It is. It's incredibly painful!
What was the Sublime Text package that you used please? That would be useful for me.
Untested code, maybe something like proc means data=dataset_name sum; var amount; by item date; output out=my_means; run;
I believe I used this one... https://github.com/rpardee/sas Also found this one that looks to be popular as well... https://github.com/MeetQingLiu/SAS-Syntax-and-Theme

I'll give that a run tomorrow. It's almost 10pm here. I used Proc Timedata with "ACCUMULATE=TOTAL" in the meantime, but even than I'm not satisfied with it. Proc Timedata would not work unless I set all (for example) ITEM "0090" into it's own table with just the AMOUNT and DATE variables. I'd rather not have to make tables for each item. Thanks a ton. I'll give you feedback on if it works when I get back tomorrow.
This is a proc sql group by statement. Proc sql; Create table agg as Select item,date,sum(amount) amt From data Group by item,date; Quit;
FWIW this would be my approach too.
Use Vi or Vim and tmux. I use R, SQL and SAS in a Unix environment where I work, and I really like Vim. It's a very powerful editor, and although the learning curve is steep, the pay off is worth while. There's a super useful plug in for R, too (if you swing that way...) 
I'd say so. In my opinion the Advanced test was easier than Base. Those prep guides are pretty on the money, so just be diligent and take practice exams and you should be fine.
You seem to have skimmed over the part about advanced data step programming and efficiencies. That part is harder to pick up in a short time than macros. How much SAS experience do you have? In answer to your original question, it depends on how much free time you have between now and October 15.
I did it. You can do it. I didn't even know how to program before I dove into the books and did base and advanced. You'll do fine as long as you are dedicated.
To answer your question: yes, it's possible to pass the exam by mid-October. But let me ask you a question in return: why are you trying to pass the exam? My guess is that you're looking for a resume builder. While it's true that a certification like advanced SAS would be a perk for me while I'm reviewing your resume, there's a danger here. Based on your certification, I'm going to try to line up the experience you have listed on your resume to see that it matches someone I'd expect to have the advanced cert. You say you know SQL, but you don't say anything specific about SAS. I'm going to assume (and please correct me if I'm wrong) that you are a beginner SAS programmer with little or no experience with base SAS. If that's the case, I would advise against getting the certification. I don't need someone on my team who can pass a test - I need someone who has the skills that makes passing the test superfluous. Meaning, in other words, that I don't really view the certification as being particularly useful. I don't mean to be a downer, but that's my genuine opinion as someone who has hired for multiple analyst/programmer positions over the past couple of years. 
I appreciate it though. I used SAS during college. At the moment, I am the only SAS programmer on my team. For that reason, I just don't have much of an opportunity to use SAS at work. While I do try to stay abreast, practice and read, I simply don't have projects at work to use SAS on. That should change in the near future as there is a project on the horizon which would have me work with other groups and help them transition to using SAS on our HPC cluster. Since I have this upcoming project, I'd like to expand my knowledge base, particularly in the realm of batch and array jobs as well as parallel processing. The resume flair is really just a bonus. 😋 If you have any suggestions for (inexpensive) educational resources, I'd love if you shared! TIA
Thanks! 
Thanks for the vote of confidence! 
Give this a shot. Proc means data=data name nway noprint; Class date item; Var amount; Output out=summa sum=; Run; It'll create a dataset called summa 
I'm in this exact situation. I have an unrelated BA with no relevant experience and my brother swore up and down that people at his job got positions with nothing more than the advanced certification. Unsurprisingly, once I got the certification, no job leads whatsoever. Would you be able to recommend some steps I could take that would at least get me an entry level position? Thanks!
That is exactly my perspective as someone who participates in hiring SAS programmers. Certifications don't benefit anyone besides SAS.
What BA is "unrelated"? I've known programmers who had virtually every major that exists. Maybe that major can get you into a company, and then you can work your way to using SAS from there. What kind of industry are you interested in?
This is a hard question to answer in general since there are a number of factors that come into play. Assuming you want to work in the healthcare industry (big umbrella term, but this could mean anything from academic research to the insurance industry), it's helpful to have some understanding of math or applied statistics. It's certainly not crucial, but helpful. I've worked with and hired beginning programmers who have a range of degrees, from physics and math to psychology (and in fact, the psychology major is one of the best programmers on my team). If you're already certified, you know enough to be qualified for an entry level position already. Find a job for a company in an industry that sounds interesting and apply. Sorry, I don't mean to brush you off or sound flippant, but that's what it comes down to for someone in your position. Feel free to PM me if you have any further more specific questions I can help answer. I'm always happy to help younger people get started in their careers.
I think there's a typo in your example data, BTW. You only have one combination of item = 0090 and date = 06/2007 (amount = 21), but in your consolidated example you have the amount total = 28. That's not really important. Someone else said this, but I would highly suggest proc sql using the group by clause. The pseudocode would be: proc sql; select item, date, sum(amount) as amount from _yourdata_ group by item, date; quit; The "group by" tells SAS to do the aggregation function (sum of amount) on every combination of item and date that it finds. 
BA in Sociology. I was thinking about the option you suggested as well. There's nothing I could contribute at my brother's place of work, but could probably get in doing customer service/grunt work for a year or two just to get my foot in the door. As for industry, some of the research/[government positions] (https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/476978400) seem pretty interesting, but at this point, I'll take what I can get just to build up experience.
Thanks for the reply! I guess I'll just have to keep plugging away until an opportunity comes along!
You'd be doing really well to get into that government job as entry level. It doesn't sound like the SAS part is too involved, and that seems like a great fit for your sociology background. I have no idea whether you have a shot at it right out of college, but it's certainly worth a try. I started out exactly as you describe with my current company. I got in with a customer contact position, and I got a promotion a year and a half later and also got the opportunity to learn SAS. After some more promotions, I'm still with same the company 20 years later. Good luck! 
I feel you could do it. I am in the same boat as you. I already have my Base Programming Certification and am now going for the Advanced. I PM'd you a website that I found helpful while studying!
https://www.sas.com/en_us/learn/software/university-edition.html Download SAS University Edition and install it, so you have a place to run SAS code. There's installation instructions on the page, using VirtualBox is the easiest method imo. Then check out tutorials, either the ones listed on that page or these older ones from the SAS YouTube channel. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVBcK_IpFVi_nlx6za9Yht0eyb46hLLrP
Using a Hierarchy may be an alternative. This lets users collapse down to the country for a sub-total at that level, but start at the state or city level (or vice versa). Graph builder may offer other options but I haven't tested it for crosstabs. It tends to be suited to very specific applications in that you need to know exactly what you want in advance (and can't easily tweak for different products).
If you have access to the Data Preparation and/or Administrator modules this is possible. These let you build, join etc from existing tables loaded to VA, or load your own data sets from Excel, Oracle etc. Typically access to these modules will be restricted, and analysts or non-admin users will be limited to Report Designer and Data Explorer.
The first online programming course is also free, it just requires registration. https://support.sas.com/edu/schedules.html?ctry=us&amp;crs=PROG1
SAS has lots of resources so you can learn from scratch. [Here is a program for Independent Learners.](https://www.sas.com/en_us/learn/academic-programs/independent-learners.html) It includes 2 free e-learning courses - Programming 1 and Statistics 1: Introduction to ANOVA, Regression and Logistic Regression, and over 200 free how to tutorials. As mentioned, you can use [SAS University Edition](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html) to practice what you learn.
It seems you are trying to do all this manually, I'm not quite knowledgable enough on the deep theory to see where you're going wrong. But I can suggest that you look into using Proc Score to score new data. You can build a dataset with the scoring coefficients you use and then put this into Proc Score along with the data to be scored and it will output the scores you require, it even does the standardization for you if you give it the means and stdevs. Hope this helps, even if it is only a bit.
Thank you for your response. I am using proc score to try to calculate the new PCs but have not been using the option to standardize. I will try this and see if it makes a difference. 
I'm still lacking "cloud computing" on my Buzzword Bingo card. Could you please try to loop that in next time you interview a tech guru?
In my experience, large institutions use SAS because of how expensive the licensing fees are. For that reason I've found side gigs or small projects to be nonexistent. More often it seems these types of requests are looking for people using open source like Python and R. I've found experfy to be a good platform but again no if you're using SAS. 
Thanks for the response. I can see the logic of your comment on why something like this doesn't exist. Maybe someone will surprise both of us. 
Really? I am constantly getting recruiters trying to sell me on temp sas jobs.
I am not sure about a single place, but I have recruiters all of the time contact me via linkedin and indeed about temp work. Mostly pharma.
Temp jobs are plenty 6-12 months contracts. But difficult to find part time jobs. LinkedIn is the best place. 
Hi, this is a great question to post at the [SAS Forecasting board](https://communities.sas.com/forecasting) on communities.sas.com. I see you've posted there before and got a reply from one of the SAS developers. I think your question is good to go as-is, but if you have a little sample data and any code you've tried, that's a bonus to help the experts understand what you need.
LinkedIn is the best platform for finding jobs &amp; career opportunity. You can also try job portals for the same.
Especially on LinkedIn
Agreed, linkedIn works best from my experience too.
I managed to hack something together to solve my question, but I'm sure there's an easier way.
A bit more information was also appended to an earlier blog post about using Python with Viya: http://blogs.sas.com/content/sasdummy/2017/06/28/python-swat-sas-viya/#trial
Here's one that may be of interest: http://www.sascommunity.org/wiki/Employment_opportunities
I'd make sure that you first have the latest hotfix for 7.11. If not, download [from the hot fix site](http://ftp.sas.com/techsup/download/hotfix/HF2/U23.html). See [this SAS Note](http://support.sas.com/kb/54/938.html) for all of the hot fix versions. The "updater" tech also gets updates occasionally, so you can't always leap frog hot fixes you haven't applied. The automatic updates handle that for you, but if you are manually applying -- then that step is up to you. If it continues to give you a problem, I suggest contacting SAS Tech Support.
Thanks a lot for this. Definitely along the lines of what I was thinking. Though I'm a bit disappointed it isn't a bit more promoted/populated.

I don't think so. You could just use proc reg to check the VIF then run through proc mixed 
You may want to check out their text miner stuff. https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/text-miner.html This topic seems to be way beyond what I have done. What kind of project are you working on?
I'm a "content curator" with a major bank. I manage our repository of documents. The thing is, we have a ton of people creating this content, uploading it to our CMS, inputting keywords, titles, and descriptions for content they've created, and most of these people have NO idea how to create effective metadata (some of them aren't even trained writers!). I need a way (which I've done through Python) to auto-summarize a document and pull out keywords, train the system to "get better" at doing that based on certain parameters, and then take the mined and processed text and auto-tag them based on either pre-built categories or help me determine better categories through concept groupings. My CMS (content management system) is setup in such a way that I have basic search functionality (content is weighted based on title, description, keywords, and tags) and I have left-hand-navigation-facets (essentially categories in which the content lives). I need a way to auto-generate most of the metadata creation through text-mining so that my contributors don't have to do it manually. This should provide consistency and create a more "Google-like" experience with my search functionality. I'll take a look at the text miner functionality. As far as I know, SAS has an ontology manager as well which is more what I need.
