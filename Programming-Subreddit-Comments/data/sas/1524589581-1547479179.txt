Might be a projection issue. Is your tableau using the same projection as the SAS dataset? Hard to say without more data.
From my understanding there are several methods to display a zip code location including regular zip, centroid, and ZCTA (zip code tabulation area). It's possible some of the most recent values could be incorrect in the SAS file. Do you have an older version you can use and plot that against the Feb 2018 dataset?
That example does look like a mistake, but in general there's no requirement for a centroid to be inside its ZIP code. It could easily happen in a ZIP code with a concave shape. Also ZIP code boundaries depend on how the map provider treats areas where mail is not delivered (and so have no official ZIP code).
The data step is incredibly powerful when you want to process through the data. Functions like lag and retain are powerful and useful tools. Do loops (do while, do until) are incredibly powerful tools for handling data. PROC SQL is nice, but I've noticed over the years a shift away from data step programming. I'm incredibly biased since I learned to program using the data step (on a mainframe, believe it or not). But even so, there are advantages to using the data step.
https://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/tutorials/case2/webprint/ Never worked with that data but this looks promising?
To expand on this, could you load all your columns into a _character_ array and then use do over to easily sweep all your variables. Example syntax below: data lib.table; set lib.table; array myVar _character_; do over myVar; myVar=Compress(myVar,’ ‘,’kad’); end; run;
Just do an export and check generate SAS code. Or you can always copy the results matrix and paste it into Excel and then read it into Sas as an .xlsx or .csv. Also, I’m very versed in Seer*Stat (I’m a registry employee), so if you have any further questions about the program or the data, feel free to ask.
Depending on the license and what it includes can make magnitudes of difference in requirements for hardware. I would open up a ticket with SAS engineering support. Also be careful, SAS is expensive and usually an individual does not typically buy a personal license and there can be tricky restrictions on just using an old license.
If you can get hold of this book it might help you. It's designed for moving in the other direction (from SAS to R) but you can use it in reverse. http://r4stats.com/books/r4sas-spss/
@mustangdvx - sounds interesting. If you'd like to commercialise your ideas, Boemska will soon be ready to work with third parties to help build commercial applications that can be listed on AppFactory (our "App Store" for SAS). One such third party application is described here: https://datacontroller.io/
Use the prep guide, and for extra practice try https://sasensei.com (disclaimer - I built the site)
Did you unarchive the sas7bndx file as well as the sas7bdat file. The index is located in the sas7bndx file.
Thanks! Most of my apps are esoteric to my company's data/business processes, but I do have some ideas which could be more commercialized. Thanks!!
I didn't do the unarchiving personally but I'm told that there it is a standalone sas7bdat file so there is no associated index. I'm fairly new to this level of programming but the file signature file is empty so hard to know how they were created. Basically, the crux of the problem is that any files that are being cross-referenced with a medical dictionary for higher order classification we are getting this message. it may be a Linux server issue but I also noticed the attributes were read only which made me think it somehow put the associated file out of sync but apparently there is no file so that theory is out the window. if any of this makes sense to you more power to you I am just a simple farm child out of me depths.
It's probably more than just SAS, your University probably also bundles it with additional SAS procedures, access products to use databases, etc.
Were you using the educational version of Stata? That is tiny. 
try the SAS university edition through the SAS official website, only takes 1-2GB, and it covers most needs for students.
Thanks all, I will download the university version from the SAS website instead of the 20GB behemoth that is offered through my U's software acquisition. Cheers!
My advice is bite the bullet. Those other 18 GB of SAS stuff is going to be a lifesaver. Why drive a Dodge Neon, when they offer a BMW for the same price?
The Stata installer is only around 300 MB and I think 1 GB installed, so OPs estimate seems fair.
You might be right. The University edition (from the SAS website) runs via virtualization and I need to point it to a huge dataset so it's probably better to have it on installed locally. It's just that 20GB! Right? That's close to a World of Warcraft install! Unless SAS is packed with sweet cinematic cut scenes that I don't know about...
I have a 512GB microSD cards and deal with datasets in the PB range so..20GB is meh...
Just add RAM, if you can't do that, then it's time to think server version.
Thanks for the response. I should have enough RAM, I’ve got 12GB and SAS doesn’t seem to be exceeding that. My coworker is running the same version of base SAS as I am, with (I believe) a similar setup in terms of CPU and RAM and it doesn’t take him anywhere near as long to run the exact same code on the exact same files.
Hope you are using a newer verision of Excel, the old versions are about as secure as a ziptie on a two foot high chain link fe nce gate. Serious now, why not just push the original data into SAS and never use Excel? Just asking.
Windows? If so is using ODBC to read the XLS an option? (Either using MS Access tools or defining a DSN?)
Place item on C drive. Remove password, upload to sas. What's the security risk? 
Define "new"- my work uses Excel 2010. The reason why I'm not pushing the original data into SAS is that the data collection is a very manual and labor intensive process that requires me to get pieces of data from a bunch of different sources- coding that into a SAS dataset would be an even bigger pain.
Have you tried looking at task manager while running? If the exact same code and hardware run at different times then I would think it would be something in the background (like /u/IkeEis suggested). Right click on the task bar and click task manager. Then click "more details" at the bottom of that window. From there you can sort by memory (or disk use or CPU) to see what is taking up the most memory. Also ensure that your computers have the same configuration of SAS installed, sometimes memory use can be limited in SAS based on the configuration.
You are good. Just curious. Are all the sources electronic? If so, I would invest the time to ETL it. If there are sources that have be manually transferred then I see your point. What a macro in the Excel doc that exports it out to a temp csv file, intiates the SAS load, then deletes the CSV file. All very doable if that would be acceptable?
I got you, those data fields make life hard. Look into the macro that drives a was program, isn't that hard really,
Possibly stupid question: can’t you copy the data onto a non-protected file and upload that file? Or do password-protected files not allow that? (I even have some of these, but one never tried to upload them to SAS.)
@gooseTheGeek - you are correct. Regarding the Viya part, we're in direct conversations with Cary R&amp;D with regard to the migration path for v9 STPs, basically the facility to create your own services isn't ready yet in CAS but should be there in about six months. At which point we'll integrate in AppFactory to ensure minimal impact to apps should our customers decide to migrate. 
I hate to say this, but DDE. You can invoke the Excel Open function and provide a password.
Honestly, and I am a big SAS fan, if this such a strong concern, I would argue w with my boss that it would be safer to leave in one place, the Excel file, that I understand and control, rather than export it to SAS were I am uncomfortable knowing the ramifications and could potential expose to greater risk, as well as double the vectors of exposure.
Assuming your have the SAS Jupyter kernel installed, you would create a new SAS notebook and then copy/paste her SAS code into cells in the notebook.
When you say "open up the SAS file" do you just want to see the code? Or be able to run it? Obviously if you want to run it, you need the Kernal installed like /u/WaitingForEmacs says. If you are just wanting to view the code however, it is only a txt file. You can open that in notepad and then copy and paste or something to that effect.
I have the Kernal installed but I wanted to run it. Thought I might just be able to open it in Jupyter with the SAS kernal rinning 
Thanks for the input, all. I'm guessing the ZIP code centroids in the SASHelp file are just slightly out of date; I found a file elsewhere that seems more reasonable, and used that instead.
My first thought is to try style formatting with an ODS escapchar. For example, if you wanted to change the color of specific text: 1. ods escapchar = '^'; (can be any character that doesn't appear in the text you want to format) 2. Replace "(text you want to format)" with "^{style [color = red] (text you want to format)}" This example turns (text you want to format) to red. I would check through SAS help website to see if there is a similar style keyword that changes background color
In addition to what /u/Calach_ mentioned by adding it to your auto-exec you wait on a connection to all of your DBs before you run any SAS Code, even local or work datasets. 
adding to this- check to see if "superfetch" is running. on my older machine this would pop up seemingly at random and caused major slowdowns. also, how are you doing on disk space, and are you clearing your work folder before ending your session so that the temp files aren't saved?
do you need that quit statement in the middle?
You are reading the data in but not assigning the data to var in the first step. 
What is it you're trying to achieve? I'm not at a SAS computer to run any of this, but it seems the two datasteps are fundamentally different, and without knowing how your raw data are structured, there's no way to guarantee this can be done (simply, at least) in one dataset. The first datastep uses a simple `input`statement. This should read in one number per line. The second uses a `@@`, which holds the line in the raw data without advancing. So this makes me think there are multiple numbers on each line on your raw text file.
SAS has hundreds and hundreds of papers and example datasets. Dive in.
how would i best demonstrate my SAS programming expertise?
any links? thank you
You should practice so that you have that expertise. And read the documentation about functions, formats, procs, macros, and basic data step programming. I'd let you demonstrate it in the interview by asking you technical SAS questions. Interviewers who don't ask those type of questions and instead rely on resumes and "experience" are asking for trouble.
Other data source ideas are the IRS and the Census Bureau. You can even bring together and analyze the data from each source.
I feel the same way when I read your data steps. SQL is aesthetic. What are these ugly merges lol
You're welcome. If you have any trouble, please feel free to message me. Just don't murder Bill Gates -- I don't have bail money.
With the exception of my first job, I have never has another where there wasn't some form of sas/coding logic test during the interview. 
Knowing how the sas system works. One big area is when to use proc sql and data step. Knowing how to effectively process your data is gold imo. Basic principle is if sql for creating data and data step for manipulating it without getting into advance things like indexing and hash. Also are you a Veteran? Big veterans discount on SAS training, books, certification costs.
I concur with this. Showing a project is cool but you will really win them over by explaining technical details about the code or functionality used to achieve the output. For example my new job. I took in a PowerPoint slide made in ODS. I used my work as s visual representation but i also explained in detail about how i made it and facing adversity (you will want to shoot your self from time to time over SAS)
Use the IFN function, inside of the concatenation. Condition it so that when something is 3, the IFN function returns nothing, but returns the regular value otherwise.
If it's literally just the digit 3 you don't like, use the compress function to filter it out after concatenating.
 concat = catx(',',compress(A,'3'),compress(B,'3')) ; 
One of the reasons I built https://sasensei.com is to make it easier for people who are genuinely good at SAS, to stand out. You can do that via your public profile, which shows all the quizzes you've passed on various SAS topics. It also shows your reputation, which is a measure of your success on the site. Yabwon (current site champion) can be seen here: https://sasensei.com/user/305 You can also see how you compare to other people in your country via the leaderboard: https://sasensei.com/leaderboard
You're probably overthinking this. All you need to do is use a simple where statement in your data step to exclude the conditions you don't want. So for example, if you don't want values where A or B is 3, this code will work. First, create a simple data set to use for testing. data one; do i = 1 to 10; a = trim(left(put(i,$2.))); b = trim(left(put(10-i,$2.))); output; end; run; Then use the where statement to get what you want. I'm old school, so my go-to concatenation function is simply ||. data two; set one(where=(a ne '3' and b ne '3'); c = a||b; run; Compressing after concatenation will work, as will a million other methods. But for my taste, the simplest approach is best. This is the simplest, cleanest, and most straightforward. In my book, that means it's preferable to others approaches. 
Thanks! Making things a bit more complicated, is it possible to exclude specific multi-character strings of numbers/letters? For example, if I wanted to exclude 'Tom' and 'Jim', can I exclude those values without SAS seeing those values as 6 individual letters to exclude in the compress function (TOMJIM) [in which case SAS would just exclude any instance of T or O or M or J, etc]? 
This is getting a little theoretical IMO. Generally speaking, yes, it is possible to do what you're asking. There are few situations where some combinations of data steps and procedures within SAS can't get you the desired result you're looking for. My suggestion is to spend some time reading up on the SAS documentation for the CATX and various concatenate procedures. Then play around with your data and see if you can make them work. Then if you're stuck and still have **specific** questions, you can post them here or Google them or whatever.
One thing you'll learn the hard way if/when you get into this career is that to succeed you need to have a tenacious mindset. Asking someone a question which is easily Google-able indicates a lazy mindset, which in my experience generally makes for subpar analysts and programmers. Sorry, I don't mean to be rude. But it's the harsh truth. 
Thank you! This worked like a charm. However I noticed that some instances of the leading backslashes have a space in between, which is causing problems (i.e. the code will remove all consecutive leading backslashes, but once it comes across a space, it halts). I can't use compress because there are other elements in my values that still require spaces (and still require some backslashes in the middle). I'm thinking one solution would be to iteratively remove a leading backslash [using the code you provided] then use strip function to remove leading spaces, and repeat until all the leading backslashes/spaces have been removed. That might not be an elegant approach, but I think it will work. Could this be done in a do loop?
Ah, I hadn't considered a space between leading backslashes. I just ran a test using "|" (basically the prx equivalent of OR) to account for this case. Try this: newVar = prxchange("s/\\+(\w+)|\\+\s+/$1/", - 1, oldVar); That should do the trick
My main concern would be forgetting to update a password and getting locked out after multiple failed attempts, or just dealing with repeated prompts asking for the correct password. If you have multiple librefs connecting to the same environment (I guess even different environments if they share passwords) you want to make sure your code checks for errors between each one. 
In the tables statement the options OUTPCT and PCT_ROW should do the trick. OUTPCT will include column and table percentages as well. If you only want the row percent then use PCT_ROW. 
Ugh thank you!
I'll throw my 2cents in. I'm a data analyst using SAS in the banking industry. Problem is it's on the way out and I think the decline is only going to get steeper. However, there's still a lot of legacy code so you can definitely get a job in that industry. And they will look favourably upon an insurance industry experience so there's some bonus points for you. My job is a lot of data extraction, cleaning, and reporting. It involves a lot of reconciliation between reports and data source. It's nothing terribly exciting but it can be interesting. The data gets pretty big in the retail world ... but it also gets horribly messy. Not to mention everybody wants everything yesterday. Which isn't so easy when working with messy data. There can be some high-pressure at times The good thing about banking is they pay very well, and there's a ton of opportunity. So it all levels out
I work for a UK retail bank. It depends where you see yourself in banking. Are you more of a programmer at heart, or more of an analyst? The difference as I see it between them is the programmers job is to code without really understanding why or the outputs. The job of an analyst is to use sas as (one of many) tools to understand the data, and then communicate the key messages to (generally non technical) senior management. I would suggest talking to some good recruiters in analytics about this, they will usually be able to advise on the best areas to move into given your interests and skill set. 
With three years experience there's no way you should be going for entry level positions. Aim for the senior ones. Also ... and I think this is true of most programming. Going past senior generally means going into the management side of things. This is not a bad thing. I'm a manager and my next role will most likely be a sr mgr position and I'll certainly break over 6figs. I'll still code but I will also get away from the computer. I guess it all depends on where you want to go. The high paying programming jobs will be in r/python and data sciences. Which really comes down to the fundamental question on everyone's mind: How do I make more money
Yeah I probably should shoot for the senior roles. I am skeptical that I would get one if I am going into anything other than insurance, mostly because I’m young (25) and many of them require at least 5 yrs. But I do have a senior analyst title right now so that helps a lot, however the pay is on the low end for senior. I’m hoping if I go into an interview and tell them I would rather get their offer before disclosing my current salary that it won’t be an issue, because they really shouldn’t need to know in order to make a fair offer. As for taking a management position, I doubt I’ll be able to find anything remote like that, and my dream is to be working from home for most of my career. I know there are some senior programmer roles that push 6 figs but I might have to do some serious hunting to secure one. And on the final note about python and R, my husband is actually contemplating that right now because he is interviewing for a SAS job and for a python job. The python one pays more but the SAS one has other perks. Tough decisions!! I am kind of trying to lean him toward the python one because he would have more flexibility long term but if the SAS one matches the salary offered by the other then he might take it. 
Just because they're asking for 5 years doesn't mean they'll get nor does it mean they'll refuse someone with 3. My general rule is I apply whenever my qualification are 70% or more of what they're asking for I'm honest when they ask me about my salary ... and I'm just as honest when I tell them my minimum expectations. Which are well above where I am. Tell your husband never lose sight of the future for the short term :) Anyhoo good luck. 
I wouldn't go as far as enjoy :) It sounds like your bored though with the reports. Given your skill set and background in statistics, I would be trying to get yourself into an analyst role, which has a focus on building models, as opposed to the endless maintenance/reporting on existing ones. This should hopefully make the new role more interesting and fitted to your skill set. 
Hi. I've done SAS programming in the umbrella "healthcare" field for my entire career (about 12 years). I've done academic research, I've worked in government, and I've worked (and work now) in the private sector. In a lot of ways, healthcare is the perfect intersection between applied statistics and SAS programming. There are different flavors of the general "data analyst" role. Some are exclusively SAS programming and data analysis focused. Others are a blend of stats and programming. It really depends on what you want. My current role is manager of analytics for a team of analysts working in the health insurance industry. We do a lot of predictive modeling based on member demographics and claims data. Work is really a combination of putting out fires and balancing longterm projects. I've been working hard during my time in this role to reduce the amount of time my team spends updating and generating static reports to a high-speed, highly-skilled team of specialists who are analytic all-stars. It's working, if slowly.
Thanks for the compliment. During my time doing biostats in an academic research setting, my position was kind of unique in that it was fully dedicated to institutional research projects that had internal funding. That meant I had a lot less volatility in my projects. Most of them were long-term projects. I had a few quick (few weeks to a month) projects, but most of them took 4-6 months from conception to completion. What I like about working in the industry over something like academic research is that it's a heck of a lot faster to identify better ways of doing something, implement the new solution, and calculate the improvement. That's not true in research. Say you work on a study which magically somehow definitively proves that drug X is better at treating a condition than drug Y. Before your work can impact people's lives who have that condition, your results have to be published. Then they have to be peer reviewed. Then they have to be replicated. Then those studies have to be peer reviewed. This isn't even mentioning how political the process to be published is. So even if you have a magic result, you're looking at years before that result filters its way into the medical world. And that's not even taking into consideration how reluctant some doctors are to change the way they practice medicine. Some physicians will continue prescribing drug Y over drug X just because that's what they've always done. Sorry, I know this is a long response. Bottom line: academic research is great, and I'm happy to have had the experience. But it's not without pitfalls. It burned me out. I'm much happier now - yes, it's not "pure research". But in my view, that's a good thing. 
Yes, [INTCK](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lefunctionsref/63354/HTML/default/viewer.htm#p1md4mx2crzfaqn14va8kt7qvfhr.htm) will do that for you.
Can you clarify your question? I am not sure what you are asking.
I have a blood sample that has to be taken between 07:00 and 10:00 for each participant (e.g 09:12:00) and I need to do a validation check that the bloods were taken within these parameters and just not sure how to do that. 
I think if you add idlabel = measurement You'll get the label for the measurement_n to be the value in that column. Not at my desk so I can't test. 
If you have another line called Id and then put the names variable in. It should work. Example : BY Id; ID Name_var; Variable Var ; Run ; Can’t test just now but hope it works. This is on my phone so sorry for crap explanation. 
Don’t apologize, this is exactly the type of insight I need. You’ve given me much to think about, thank you! I could see how research would be rewarding under the right circumstances but with the long drawn out process to see the effect of your work, it might be tough to stay motivated and enthusiastic.

Thanks, selitos gave me the right solution. I used the id=measurement thing too before you suggested it, I'm not sure why it still comes out wrong, but one never knows SAS. Haha. But thank you so much :)!!!
Are you on the same network? I used to have the same setup as my coworkers but when I switched offices my queries slowed to snail pace because of the location of the servers. Another note would be that I have sped queries from hours to minutes by using dynamic loops. If you need help making your code more efficient maybe you could give us some info on what the data looks like and what you are trying to do with it. I’m not allowed to change my computer components at work so I obviously have to do the best I can with the machine they give me. 
We are running on a windows server environment (2012), SAS 9.4. When I was referring to interactive mode I was meaning loading up the SAS IDE, sorry for the confusion. Initially the idea was that using autoexec.sas to auto load our standard initialization steps (standard libraries, macro variable creation, etc) would be cleaner than using an include statement. However after running into the issues with using autoexec in the IDE mode, I'm thinking the trouble probably isn't worth it for just removing one line of code from a program. At this point my question is more to satisfy my own curiosity.
You need to create a shortcut to SAS with the appropriate options on the command statement, e.g. c:\program files\sas\sas.exe -autoexec "n:\team folder\autoexec.sas"
I think it's due to the length of the resulting trimmed_answer variable. If you run this: data testtest1; set good_bad; trimmed_answer = trim(answer); answer_len=length(answer); trimmed_answer_len = LENGTH(trimmed_answer); verify1=verify(trimmed_answer,'ABCabc0123456789'); verify2=verify(trim(answer),'ABCabc0123456789'); run; You'll find that verify1 for "1234AcB876acccCCC" is 18 whereas verify2 is 0. The trimmed_answer_len for that same value is 17. That means it's picking up the first non correct character after the final character of the string. Reading up on the trim function, it seems like if the length of the variable is not supplied (in this case trimmed_answer), SAS assigns it the length of the argument (so in this case $40). I'm guessing that due to that, and ironically enough, SAS is padding out trimmed_answer with blanks. Or at the very least enough so that it is confusing the verify function.
No problem. Concerning the length/lengthn function. Note that both of these exclude trailing blanks. Change the length function to lengthc and you'll see a length of 40. &gt; &gt; Could I ask a favour? I'd love to know where you found the detailed information about this behaviour. I've been referencing the SAS Language Reference online, I don't think I came across any similar information. If you're asking about the trim function functioning, it was just in the online help documentation: [here](http://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=lefunctionsref&amp;docsetTarget=n1io938ofitwnzn18e1hzel3u9ut.htm&amp;docsetVersion=9.4&amp;locale=en) If you're asking about the information on the weirdness of SAS and the length, it's not really any one place. It's just an issue I've encountered on and off when manipulating data. However there may be others reading this that may have an actual source they can point you towards.
Thank you very much! The length behaviour with SAS is particularly interesting to me. My programming experience is not so much from the statistical package side of things and this kind of behaviour is not something that I've encountered in other languages. It's definitely good to know. 
It's just coefficient (cronbach's) alpha for dichotomous variables. Use alpha . proc corr data=whatever alpha; ...; run; 
Are you using base SAS or SAS Enterprise Guide?

Can you elaborate on the tenacious mindset and offer an example of why or how that leads to better programming? I want to not make these mistakes in m career 
You could try PROC CLUSTER, which supports a dendogram output. See this [example from the documentation](https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63962/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_cluster_sect025.htm).
Depends on a few bits - most key of which is: how does Windows authentication work from your SAS infrastructure to the SQL box? Username and Password? Kerberos tickets? Also, do you have a SAS Metadata Server to centralise this definition of the library? If not, what is your plan to create this central library definition?
Late to the party I know, but have you compared your memsize settings with your coworker, also? SAS doesn't use all the memory on a machine, it grabs up to the amount of memory you assign through the memsize option, and cannot grab any more. You can increase the memsize parameter - but not within a session. To change it, go to the sasv9.cfg on your machine (I'm assuming you're running locally rather than on a server). It's often set to about 2GB - if you're confident that you need it, nothing wrong with increasing it. To confirm it's worked, you can run the below in a session, and it'll tell you the current value of the setting. Putting the "value" option on below, also shows you where it's currently set, if you're having issues finding where that sasv9.cfg is. proc options option=memsize value; run; Also, look into SortSize option, as that can (as the name suggests) affect sort speed. Bear in mind that the memsize is the maximum you can use for the session, so sortsize can't exceed memsize. Also, SAS can and will use all memory according to the memsize, so, for example, if you set the memsize to 6GB and start 2 SAS sessions - there's a chance you'll eat 12GB of memory just for SAS, if both sessions are running intensive tasks at the same time. That could blue screen your machine - or at the least page out to disk, which will be slower again.
Assuming you are doing this though a service account, you COULD enable token authentication and set sassrv or whatever account runs the workspace server with the appropriate "Trusted" credentials. However, you really need to sit down and think about what exactly it is you want because enabling Token Authentication has additional impacts. 
SAS’ website should have some video tutorials
Search SAS training in the official page, there are two free online courses for starters. 
SAS only calculates left and right probabilities for 2x2 tables. Your data is 2x4 so it only calculates an overall probability (that each row and each column is equal). http://support.sas.com/kb/22/566.html If you do the same analysis but with just a pair of religions, you'll get your left and right values. proc freq data=test(where=(religion in ('jewish', 'other'))) order=data; tables comp95*religion / chisq expected fisher; weight count; run;
If I understand right, I think this should do it :) proc sql; create table test as select location, product_cat, count(*) as frequency from dataset group by 1,2; quit;
data xxx; set source_dataset ; dummy=1; *create a dummy variable in your new dataset; run; proc sort data=xxx; by location product; run; proc means data=xxx; var dummy; by location product; output out=product_means; *** output dataset with counts, and mean counts of products at each location; run; I'm not too familiar with SQL but base on my programming experiences, I would approach it this way. 
As far as I can see this would also work. 
Thank you for responding, but I am still confused. I tried both of these methods, but then when I ran: &gt;proc sort data=dataset2; &gt;by location; &gt;run; &gt;proc means data=dataset2; &gt;var product_cat; &gt;by location; &gt;run; I got different answers and also different from what I got from doing it by hand. For example, the mean at location 9 for proc sql was 4.5 (n=8). The n=8 make sense to me since there are 8 product categories. When I did it by the dummy variable, I got a mean of 5.1 (n=27). The n=27 also make sense since that was the sum of the frequencies among location 9. When I copied and pasted from the proc freq and did a mean, I got 3.375. Any thoughts on which is correct? Or maybe I'm not doing it correctly. Thanks! 
I guess I should also mention that I need the mean number of "displays" per store (Store_ID) by location and product_cat. I read this in a paper similar to what I am trying to do: "Each separate location where 1 of the 8 product categories was found was counted for each store, and a mean across the x stores was calculated."
Both of these methods will work equally well to calculate this so I'm not sure why you're seeing the differences. If you're able to mock up a dummy dataset in excel, and calculate the outputs in there and upload it somewhere, I would be more than happy to write some sas code to show how the sas code creates what's done in excel if that would be helpful? 
Yes, that would be very helpful! I can also send you the table shells I need to report out. Do I email you through reddit? I don't think I can attach anything via reddit.
I doubt it, but I'm sure you could put in on Dropbox or something and pm me a link. If you just mock up the full calculation of the averages (from raw dummy data to the tables you need) in excel I'll take a look at how to code in sas. 
[communities.SAS.com](https://communities.sas.com) is great. Lots of active SAS users who are willing to help, and most questions get responses pretty quickly. StackOverflow also has a SAS forum, which I've seen from Google search results but haven't (yet) participated in.
You could try posting here. Lots of people ask for help or troubleshooting, and they usually get helpful responses.
You need to reference it as maxdte{i} inside the do loop.
Thanks! Did I need to include the new array maxdte{3} maxdte1 maxdte2 maxdte3, or was that unnecessary since I'm creating maxdte as a new variable in the do loop? 
That was right. That part should at least work. For readability, you can also put 4 spaces at the beginning of each line: like this.
 test test
Thanks! 
You're welcome.
Hm, I ran the code again and ran into some more errors if you would be willing to help. I'll let you know when I edit the post. 
I edited the post if you would be willing to help out. 
The month and day seem to be reversed in the mdy function. I'm not sure exactly where that happened.
Indeed tl;dr but the mdy function expects three arguments and the first one is for month -&gt; 17 is out of range for the month argument (1-12).
There are free video tutorials on Youtube. Search on SAS University Edition tutorials.
&gt; Long story short does SAS allow you to work with data files larger than your memory? Yes, absolutely. SAS' RAM use is set via the setting "memsize". You can determine what memsize your SAS session has been set to by running the below (the value option shows you which configuration file set it): proc options option=memsize value; run; When SAS "runs out" of memory based on its allocation, it'll write out temporary files to disk while it calculates what it needs to - either to work (you might see a file "dataset_name.sas7bdat.lck" or your utility file location (often the same parent directory as your work folder).
I see thanks!
I wouldn't say that as a rule SAS loads one observation at a time. The data step generally processes one obs at a time, but might buffer many more. A hash object can load an entire data set into memory, and procs vary widely in their use of memory. Some procs can use temporary files in lieu of memory, and others can't. Also, I think that neither formats nor hash objects can be swapped to disk.
I see. Thanks for clarifying!
Another example- any proc that uses a class statement will need enough memory to hold all the levels of all the class variables.
There are a few free e-learning courses that may be helpful, if you are looking for basic resources to get started. SAS Programming 1 and Statistics 1 are both good intro-level courses: [free e-Learnings](https://support.sas.com/edu/elearning.html?ctry=us&amp;productType=library)

Assuming by binary you mean actually 1/0’s then in a data step: Var_cnt = sum(var1,var2,var3,var4,var5); If var_cnt &gt;= 3 then Status= ‘High’; Drop var_cnt; If they are a yes/no or true/false character binary you will need to convert to 1/0 or use a different approach. 
perhaps: high_participation = sum(of participation:) &gt;= 3; then if you've got a 0 there you know it's low and can do other things with it if you want. The : syntax is a var list that should work, but you can alterntively type out participation1, participation2, etc... 
There's probably a few ways to do this but one way is to use a combination of sum and ifc data testdata(drop=i); array vararray var1 var2 var3 var4 var5; do i=1 to 20; do over vararray; vararray=round(rand("UNIFORM"),1); end; output; end; run; data want; length group $4; set testdata; group=ifc(sum(of var:)&gt;=3,"HIGH","LOW"); run; 
[Look Here](http://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=grstatgraph&amp;docsetTarget=n07s2oezv7f654n1xkbrqlrianbf.htm&amp;docsetVersion=9.4&amp;locale=en) There is an option called "SEGMENTLABELTYPE" that seems to be what you want. There are a few other options that begin with SEGMENTLABEL to help control the positioning and appearance.
That did the trick! Thank you

Sum(Case when smoke="yes" and age=18 then 1 else 0 end) as count_smoke18 Something like that?
I'd use some form of if statement in a data step, but a case when in an sql would work equally well... It's personal preference. 
Kinda, but it has to do it for all ages, and not a specific one.
But a loop in a case statement?
If you can make it work, go for it. Personally I'd keep it simple by using an if statement in a data step. 
My first stop would be to check all the options using proc means, that can definately do SD (pop and sample) and also weight things. Not sure if you can specify clusters and strata though.
Hey, b11haf, just a quick heads-up: **definately** is actually spelled **definitely**. You can remember it by **-ite- not –ate-**. Have a nice day! ^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
You can accomplish this with a double dow loop. Basically, it loops through the data once and summarizes by age group (in this case, were there any non-smokers). Then it loops through a second time to apply the created variable (anyno) to each observation. data testdata; input age smoke $; datalines; 18 Y 18 Y 18 Y 19 N 20 N 20 Y 21 N 21 N 22 Y ; run; proc sort data=testdata; by age; run; data want; length anyno $1; do _N_=1 by 1 until(last.age); set testdata; by age; if smoke="N" then anyno="N"; end; do _N_=1 by 1 until(last.age); set testdata; by age; if missing(anyno) then anyno="Y"; output; end; run;
Something like this works: PROC SQL; CREATE TABLE AllYes AS SELECT Age, CASE WHEN SUM(Smoking = "No") &gt; 0 THEN "No" ELSE "Yes" END AS Result FROM Data ; QUIT;
Proc sql; Create table age as Select min(case when yes then 1 else 0 end) as flag, age From data Group by age; Data age; Set age; If flag = 1 then flag_char= ‘yes’ ; else flag_char=‘no’ Run; Does this do what you want?
Haven't tested but this should work proc sql; create table want as select a.age, a.smoking, b.output from have as a left outer join (select distinct age, min(smoking) as output from have group by age) as b on a.age=b.age ; quit;
A lot is going to depend on how your data is set up. But the way I would approach it would be to merge vital signs into the exposure data by subject and visit (there should be a timepoint variable that will indicate if the vs measurement was for timepoint 12,24 and 48, if there isn't then that introduces other issues) so that you have the date/time of the dose and the date/time of the vital signs in the same data set. Then you can set up checks that should be fairly straight forward comparisons of the dose date time to the vital signs date time.
Yeah these were my thoughts too. Thanks you for your help you're good people!.
You're beautiful! Thank you!!!
Wpat?
That is beautiful, I just wish I understood why it works. It's adding all the NOs?
I do not agree that asking a question that is easily found by doing a search is a deal breaker for me because sometimes it is better to see how the people who you work around are solving the problem since it can give you insight into what their expectations are. Sometimes it can also give you a chance to expand upon the question you have or verify that you are asking the right question. Some places have specific ways they want something done and it can cause conflict down the line no matter how much better you feel you are doing it better. The only deal breaker for me is if you ask that question more than once after I have explained it to you fairly clearly. I give everyone at least a chance to ask the question twice and any more than that; I don't feel that they will ever get it or are not properly taking notes as they should be.
Yes. r/conmanau (Hi, I'm replying on your behalf! :) ) did was to sum all the "No"s by Age group. If the age group has at least 1 "No", it will satisfy the initial condition of "SUM(Smoking = "No") &gt; 0" which will result to an output of "NO". The only time the initial condition will not be satisfy is when we have 0 "No"s which also means the records are all "YES". This will result to the alternative output which is "YES". I hope this makes sense.
/u/Gale4orce1 answered it pretty well, but I'll break it down a little more: (Smoking = "No") Is a calculation that returns 1 when the situation is true, and 0 when it isn't. SUM(Something) GROUP BY Age Gives you the sum of Something in each age grouping. In this case, we're adding up the Smoking = "No" indicators, so we get the count of how many "No" answers there are for each age. CASE WHEN X THEN TrueValue ELSE FalseValue END Is essentially like an IF statement, but turned into a calculation. So in the situation where there is at least one "No" answer, it returns the result "No", otherwise it returns "Yes".
when you say "On the Way Out"... what do you mean? What will be more popular you recommend?
Are you asking how to use them in SAS code? Or for overall Stats knowledge/use?
Just for overall stats knowledge and use. I know the code for them, but I’m sometimes confused about when to use certain bits of information. 
I’m currently in the middle of the SAS course for the advanced stats cert as part of a Data Analytics degree. I’m struggling, too, so you’re not alone, but my understanding is that ANOVA is for when you have a continuous numerical target/result variable and multiple either continuous or categorical predictor variables. Continuous = numerical and calculable, analyzed as a number (weight, height, etc.) Categorical = numeric or character, but for statistical analysis, essentially coded values where a value is typically used more than once. If numeric, it’s not used as a number and doesn’t have a calculable value compared to other records (Diabetes Type, floor of a building, birth order). Linear regression is for when everything is numeric/continuous. Logistic regression is for when the target is continuous but the predictors can be categorical. ANOVA is for when your target is categorical so you’re analyzing or predicting how the data influences a value that is a numeric result ANOVA: whether closest city at birth and level of education have an influence on current distance from closest city at birth Single linear regression: whether distance from closest city at birth influences distance from current closest city Multiple linear regression: whether distance from closest city at birth and age influence distance from current closest city Logistic regression: whether closest city at birth and level of education influence current closest city
Use proc standard to standardise. Use Fastclus to cluster the data initially. Then use the output of Fastclus as an input to Proc Cluster. This process is pretty well documented on the SAS support site.
Thanks dear, When I standardize is it normal to get negative values in some attributes? 
AnalyticsExam.com looks interesting, did you pay for the practice exams?
Yes, you should aim for values between -1 and 1, but this isn't always possible with Proc standard.
Ok dear thanks a lot. 
I did pay for the exams, unfortunately it’s about $40 although I did see three of the exact questions I had on the practice tests so to me.. seems worth it. 
I don't see an attached image but is this the sort of error you're getting? [Link](http://support.sas.com/kb/52/716.html) If so, it's likely due to character(s) in the csv file that the default SAS exe doesn't handle. First I would try to determine what the character(s) are that are causing the issue, basically you want to know if it's a one time issue or if it's something that will happen again and again (i.e. a dataset that will always have Chinese characters). Based on that answer I would use the link provided to try some different ways of handling it.
Thank you so much for replying. I don't think that's my error, but its similar and is what I was thinking, but my boss uses the same dataset with no problem. It's why I was thinking it must be an error in my coding. 
also, the image still shows as processing on my end as well. hopefully it pops\-up
It could be your boss has a different encoding setting than you do, which is why we suggested you look at the data. Focus on row 21 since everything imported correctly up until that point
I believe this is caused by using a 'limiting' encoding for the SAS session. What encoding is used in your dataset and what encoding is used for SAS session? Check this with proc contents for dataset and proc options for, well, options. Assuming they are different, to fix this you need to change SAS server configuration: you need to edit sasv9.cfg or whatever it is called and add option for encoding like UTF8. 
Thank you guys. 
It's not unheard of. My employer does not manage their data warehouse this way, but we partner with a number of organizations that do maintain data warehouses in SAS. When you consider that the purpose of a data warehouse is to maintain a convenient integrated repository of data for analytic/reporting purposes, it's not surprising that some organizations find it convenient to maintain said data in the native format of their main analytical tool. That said it can certainly become unwieldy as your data needs grow beyond a certain point. Whether or not it makes sense for you to move to a more specialized DBMS will depend on the nature of your organization, the volume of your data, and the purpose of the particular data warehouse. One possible way to scale up such a data warehouse without changing the paradigm too much would be to switch from using regular SAS files to using the SAS [Scalable Performance Data Engine](https://support.sas.com/rnd/scalability/spde/index.html), which can provide better performance for reading large amounts of data.
Thanks!
Whether to use SAS as a data warehouse also depends on your hardware. SAS Grid, for example, seems to be pretty fast. I've been amazed at the processing speed for 100 million or more observations.
Not real a bad idea if you are using the EDW for reporting or analytics. Not a wise idea if you using it for production systems with lots of roads and writes on a constant basis to the same tables. 
Great point. They also have IBM DB2 and Oracle databases for "production" system, like a software for sales personnel. But the SAS DW environment also has an environment described as production, beside one for testing and one for developing SAS programs in it. The SAS programs usually analyze some data or create reports. It's a bank, so I'm not sure if that's actually all they need or not. It seems to be working well, though.
That's common in banking. There are DEV, TEST, UAT, PROD even for reporting and analytical EDWs. The environment you describe sounds eerily familiar....the bank with the stagecoach?
Outlier? Probably ill formatted datapoint
Thanks for the answer, what do you mean by format?
Definitely outlier of a skewed distribution. This is not uncommon in my experience when you are working with such a large dataset. Your distribution is likely lognormal and the estimated st.dev is small compared to the full range, hence the enormous outlier. I would suggest a log or box cox transformation to see if the data looks cleaner - although it still might not, and you make do with what you have (depending on your purpose) 
Ok thanks for your support, I’ve thought about transformation using log normal. Tomorrow I’ll applied it to see the results l. Thanks dear.
why not use proc univariate to plot a histogram to see the distribution? it's likely only a few large data points with tons of near zeros.
Thank you for your post! &gt; http://support.sas.com/training/us/sp1.html Is this the site you talk about in your first bullet point? Just wanted to make sure I am studying correctly. Also, is it a good starting material. I personally have 0 background on SAS (I only have some background in R). Just wondering if this help with fundamental. Thanks!
Yupp that’s the site, under the e-learning section. IMO it’s the best starting place. I can’t say if other books/sites may be better but as a free resource it covers the basics of getting started with SAS. Plus the fact it’s a narrated video explanation rather than just text is much nicer. The site lessons jump around a bit in relation to the study guide so if you do the site first, you will have most of the basic knowledge and then are just filling in the gaps and getting more advanced with the book guide. As far as prior knowledge I’d say little to none is really assumed and if you have experience with R, the concepts will all come easier. If you’re interested I believe the SAS site also has a section called something like “Learning SAS for those who know R”. Obviously it’s not that exact title but it’s a course for those with prior knowledge of R to learn SAS. As far as being free I’m not sure either, I just checked it out in passing on the site. Maybe take a look for extra resources 
Thank you so much for your help! 
What happens when you use NOMISS option?
If you're looking to get into SAS, get yourself a copy of The Little SAS Book. You can get the third edition used for $2, which is more than enough to get you started.
Does &amp;_sasprogramfile exist and is it non blank? sysfunc(dequote(&amp;_sasprogramfile)) will otherwise resolve to sysfunc(dequote())
SAS offers a lot of free and low-cost resources for students: https://www.sas.com/en_us/learn/academic-programs/students.html Your university will likely have free SAS training, and you’ll learn a ton from profs and fellow students by working on projects together. Just googling any coding issue that arises will lead to a ton of information on solutions, sample code, and best practices...so you will learn a lot from resolving problems that crop up while doing projects. In my experience, having SAS skills will put you in higher demand, and certification could be worth it...but I learned SAS *before* certification was even a thing so I’m not sure what the value-added would be. Good luck!
I solved it It was just a quirk with SAS9 where I basically did the old adage of turning it off and on again.

Not that I am aware of. I have the the book that SAS sells and that is it.
I have been doing this in tableau for a while now with similar results. I guess it depends on what tool you like best.
Are you asking about the Big Data certification that is a component of the SAS Academy for Data Science? Since that is such an intensive program, with 9 different modules, there isn't a book that would cover the entire content for both exams the way the Base or Advanced exam prep guides would. There are [practice exams](https://www.sas.com/en_us/certification/resources/sas-practice-exams.html) available through Pearson VUE that may be helpful though! 
How you handle the case where grp is 3 is up to you. However, your code does not assign a value to classc2 or classc2 when grp is 3, so of course those two dummy variables are set to missing. If you want the dummy variables to be 0 when grp is 3, then you could alter your code to this: if grp=1 then classc1=1; else classc1=0; if grp=2 then classc2=1; else classc2=0; Alternatively, you could use the fact that a Boolean expression returns a 1 or 0 for true and false and write it more succinctly like this: classc1 = grp eq 1; classc2 = grp eq 2; 
I bet you can guess which tool I like best! ;)

Unless there's a reason you don't want to count the "var1 = 1" record, you need to remove the else. If you want to determine when it's reading a new subID, sort and use first. and last. logic.
As xmindallas said, First. Last. logic may work well in the data step. However I would be more inclined based on the code you put forward to use proc sql. proc sql; create table WANT as select subID, sum (case when var1 eq 1 then 1 else 0 end) as count from IN group by SubID; quit;
&gt;proc sql; &gt; &gt;create table WANT as select subID, &gt; &gt;sum (case when var1 eq 1 then 1 else 0 end) as count &gt; &gt;from IN &gt; &gt;group by SubID; &gt; &gt;quit; Sorry for the late reply but I got it working. Thank you so much!
 Sorry for the late reply but I got it working. Thank you so much! 
sas analytics is shit
Why do you say so? What’s so bad about it?
I think the following is the same as your SQL code: PROC SQL; CREATE TABLE dash.month_cnt_team AS SELECT Period, group, ProductType, COUNT(1) AS acct_cnt FROM dasj.month_dep GROUP BY Period, ProductType, Group; QUIT; 
Not surprised that a sas user can't count to 4
No retain is needed because your "acct_cnt+1" causes SAS to auto retain the acct_cnt variable.
 do i =1 to 4; put i; end;
This is how real SAS programmers count to 4: &gt; do i = 1 to 3; end; put i;
🙈
You have a bit of a pickle on your hands. Unfortunately SQL is not good at counting records and resetting on an if condition. Usually when doing something with this logic you are either looking for the first or last member of a group for multiple groups. SQL doesn't really do that. I would really love to be proven incorrect, so if you find a solution please share. The good news is that you can just use sas.
Well what do they mean when they say "SAS Analytics"? That can be a huge difference of opinion since that is a vague term....
I think it’s the visualization stuff like tableau? The dashboard visuals I think, at least that’s what I’m getting from google 
We've always used `monotonic()`, with the understanding that it might come back and bite us in the ass someday of course. :)
I also have a translation question, but from SQL to SAS. There's a table A with two columns: claim number and line number. Claims can have any number of lines, most have 5-10 lines, and line count starts from 0. Some claims only have line 0 and some claims start sequence from 1 rather than 0. Line numbers are unique per claim, so no two of the same line number per claim. The business reason that sequence might start from 1 rather than 0 is because 0 is a header record while 1 through X is a detail record. Not all claims have a header record and vice versa. If I want claims with a header record and detail records, I would create a temp list with all claims with a detail record. Then the query would look for line=0 while claim is also in that temp list. A coworker who is new to both SQL and SAS asked...well why the f cant u just write "where line_number in (0,1)" SAS can do that. Can SAS do that? How would you do this in SAS in general? 
I've decided to tackle your questions and show you some flexible options using both DATA step processing and PROC SQL. `data A;` `input claim_num line_num;` `datalines;` `1 0` `1 1` `2 1` `2 2` `2 3` `3 0` `4 0` `4 1` `5 1` `;` `run;` `* Note: this gives undesirable results because 1 or 2 records are returned per claim_num;` `proc sql;` `select * from A` `where line_num in (0, 1)` `order by claim_num;` `quit;` `* Here's the same mistake using a DATA step this time.;` `data A_wrong;` `set A;` `where line_num in (0, 1);` `run;` `proc print data=A_wrong noobs;` `run;` `* Here's a correct solution using a DATA step.;` `* Note sorting in required.;` `proc sort data=A out=A_sorted;` `by claim_num line_num;` `run;` `data A_right;` `set A_sorted;` `by claim_num;` `if first.claim_num;` `run;` `proc print data=A_right noobs;` `run;` `* Here's a correct solution using PROC SQL.;` `* Note that sorting is not required, but the code appears more complex.;` `* The correlated subquery could make things a little difficult to read` `* so this could be refactored as an inner join to be more readable. ;` `proc sql;` `select one.*` `from A as one` `where line_num = (select min(line_num)` `from A as two` `where one.claim_num = two.claim_num` `group by claim_num)` `order by claim_num;` `quit;` `* Here's the same query, refactored as an inner join. ;` `proc sql;` `select two.*` `from (select claim_num, min(line_num) as line_num` `from A` `group by claim_num) as one` `inner join` `(select *` `from A) as two` `on one.claim_num = two.claim_num` `and one.line_num = two.line_num` `;` `quit;`
This will do the trick. As a side note, if any other columns are included that are not the grouping variables or the newly created count variable, the query will require remerging and can quickly become inefficient.

This is a game changer! Now if only I can convince my company to upgrade to the latest version of SAS...
I think you'll be okay typing some macro statements for now.
IS this in SAS 9.4 or do we need to upgrade? 
No. Down with dummy macros!
Thanks for the tip and caveat. I will have a look at it and poke around. Cheers.

That reminds me...in no world is: %if 0 %then %do; stuff %end; easier than: %macro norun; stuff %mend norun;
I've never seen monotonic() used in PROC SQL, and now I know it -- it's undocumented! From a SAS community wiki: &gt;The MONOTONIC function is often presented as a means of adding sequence numbers to table rows. Several papers present it as a solution to this programming problem. However, the function is undocumented and has some limitations, including: &gt; &gt;\* If the MONOTONIC function is used in an [SQL procedure](http://www.sascommunity.org/wiki/SQL_procedure) that aggregates data then the function may return non-sequential or missing results. &gt; &gt;\* If two different statements use the MONOTONIC function then a separate number sequence is returned for each statement. So yeah...it seems like this would be a dangerous function to rely on in production code. COUNT(1) would be better, or maybe moving some business logic to a DATA step if row numbers are actually required.
Then I agree with other poster, SAS Visual Analytics is crap. Annoying software that doesn't even hold a candle to Excel. Frustrating and truly difficult to do any meaningful nontrivial work.
I wasn't aware there was a certification for CDISC? 
More or less.. [SAS Clinical Trials Programmer Certification](https://www.sas.com/en_us/certification/credentials/foundation-tools/clinical-trials-programmer.html)

Man I really appreciate this. I'm not too familiar with non-tsql programming languages, but I knew it couldn't be as easy as "line in (0,1)" or a SAS variant with a one line short piece of code
You're welcome. SAS is a language really unlike many others, though the SQL facilities are reasonably interoperable with other SQL flavours.
I'm not really sure what the level counts are doing in your example, because it doesn't seem like they should change for the Fac B tables, but I made the assumption that you're just counting when level is = 1 for X and Y in each table. The code below should be easy enough to edit to do whatever you want. data test ; input outcome $ fac $ level ; cards ; X A 1 Y A 1 X A 1 X A 1 X A 1 X B 2 Y B 2 Y C 1 Y C 1 X C 1 ; run ; %macro counts(fac=) ; proc sql ; select outcome , sum(case when fac = "&amp;fac." then 1 else 0 end) as &amp;fac._count , sum(case when level = 1 then 1 else 0 end) as level_1_count , count(*) as outcome_count from test group by outcome ; quit ; %mend ; %counts(fac=A); %counts(fac=B); %counts(fac=C); 
Basically this, but put the tabulates in your loop too.
Becoming SAS certified can help you get a foot in the door when it comes to getting a job right out of college. Take a stab at the base certification by leveraging the Small SAS book and the offficial book, download the University version for practice and you should be ready to take the exam in 3 months. Good luck!
Can you elaborate? 
Hi There - I'm using SPARCS data too and having the same issue for reading in the file. Did you ever get this figured out?
Yea I guess the first time I grabbed the data is was corrupted or something. Because I grabbed another copy of it and I just ended up importing into a sql database. Not sure if that would work for you. 
I do want to get it into a sql database. how did you go about importing it? Just from the .dat file?
Yea I believe you have to import from flat file and then create the columns and then import. 
Thanks a ton. I'll try this.
VA is touted as this grandiose analytical slicer and dicer which is complete rubbish. You basically have to have data already specifically in the form you need it for a report and all it really can do is take 10x longer to create a visualization as any other tool. Oh you need to transpose your data? Good luck with that in VA. You have to break the seals and code it out with a PROC TRANSPOSE, ruining anything the UI gives you. Oh want to make SQL on the fly? Well due to the limitations of JS UI you can write queries but if they are too long, you can not save them! You have text you want to be a number, or vice versa? Yeah...well that takes some undocumented coding tricks. VA is just plain crap. Feels like a half baked software that overcomplicates the simplest things and can not do anything you expect it would be able to given the price tag. 
Suddenly qlikview &amp; excel pivot charts don't seem so bad...
There has been nothing I have been asked to do in VA by a client that I could not do in Excel or R in a tenth of the time with a hundredth of the frustration.
tldr: Non-probability sample, "Data Scientist", pie charts.
Let's make sure the admins understand that this article is referencing system-generated SAS logs -- not the ones created by user SAS jobs. The latter are often relevant for much longer than six months due to a variety of reasons.
Well yeah, as every ysed car salesman and wannabe marketing professional gets into data science, the free tools will grow disproportionately. Show me what percentage of healthcare, pharmacy, or finance devs have abandoned SAS in favor of other tools, and then we have a discussion.
So long as SAS continue to cosy up to the regulators, I'd say they've nothing to worry about. For now, at least.
Yep. They know their niche, and have precious little reason to try competing outside of it.
I’m happy to use sas at work, but there is no way I am going to pay for it for my personal use. I’m sure non-profits and start ups feel the same way. 
Donut charts. So in right now. 
Can I see that in cornflour blue?
SAS is soon to be legacy software. I'm a long time sas user but I think we have to realize that there is nothing that SAS has on these open source tools
That’s very optimistic thinking. It is not going anywhere for the meantime. They have a huge stronghold in Big Pharma and Finance.
I work for a major insurance company that utilizes SAS. I use R and see how many of the new hirers are coming with R knowledge / background. Coming from university that teach it and use it in Stats
If you're trying to actually learn SAS, practicing writing programs, running them, and reading the log would be time better spent. Then you won't be setting yourself up for failure if you actually get a programming job.
Yeah I've been doing that using the programs in the prep guide.
You say this, perhaps as a developer. But what other solution gives me, as the analytics environment administrator, the ability to track data source usage across projects, centralize access do many different databases, show me compute resource usage and load balancing my users across servers. It seems to still be pretty useful for me as an admin that needs to manage resources for teams of users. But I dont really have much exposure to other products that do this as well.... 
True. But isn't just a matter of time? If new hires know Python and it's free ...
I'm a statistician. Ok that's an interesting point. In the large companies I've worked I didn't have much exposure to needs of the admins. I'm working at a small company now and we don't get much support. 
Not necessarily. It depends how much risk rides on a computational or logic error. The major benefit of SAS is not so much that it automates many statistical routines, but that the entire product has undergone extensive validation that the software and routines perform as intended. If a company is shopping around for a product, they need to do a lot of work up front validating their own tools or freely available tools or they can buy a product that offers a certain level of guarantee.
Yeah, sas is only for old men
You can definitely use regular expressions to extract the dates and times (look up the help for prxparse(), prxmatch(), and prxposn()). It's unclear to me, though, how standardised your input data records are. You do have to feed an input string into the regex functions, and if they're not in a predictable pattern, you might not be able to construct a RE that can handle everything.
Well done. I have just been hunting for a way to transpose my data similarly, so this was super helpful. 
What platform is it on? If it's on Unix/Linux, you can always use some scripting to extract the records you want. For example, if some particular string is in the records you want to keep, you can so something like: grep KEEP myfile.txt &gt; keep_records.txt. That would put the records with "KEEP" in them in a new file called keep_records.txt. If it's something more complicated that you need to do to determine what to keep, there are other functions like awk or even regular expressions that you could use. I haven't used SAS University, but I believe there are limitations on the number of records you can read. If you're close to the limit (or don't mind a bunch of repetition), you can try the "split" command in Unix. It should break your file at the end of a record.
Sorry, the page you were looking for in this blog does not exist.
You need to be clear in what you are trying to accomplish. For example, are you really trying to determine if the mortality rate (proportion of 1s to total cases) are significantly different for a given surgery type? Or ???? 
SAS university edition is indeed a possibility to read in the entire dataset and also split the dataset into chunks, as well as perform other subsetting. This [FAQ](https://support.sas.com/software/products/university-edition/faq/data_sizelimits.htm) link explains that there are no specific limits on dataset size except for what your machine limits are. In that link you will also find relevant articles are splitting one dataset into smaller pieces.
I can't speak for these test bank services, but for that money you are much better off purchasing a practice exam from SAS itself. Then you'll be guaranteed to have questions similar to what you'll get on the exam. I used it and found it to be helpful.
Thank you for this!
You're welcome.
My only problem with PROC TRANSPOSE is that I can never remember how to manipulate it to get the results I want so it takes about 5 tries, and in the end it turns out I have to TRANSPOSE, then do some DATA step manipulation, then TRANSPOSE again. But having done that, it's definitely a powerful PROC.
Has it? https://www.burtchworks.com/2018/07/16/2018-sas-r-or-python-survey-results-which-do-data-scientists-analytics-pros-prefer/
Glad you found it helpful!
If you deal with similar data frequently, hopefully you can re-use your code (with slight changes), rather than have to start from scratch! :)
SAS was already in a lot of big companies so it had a head start when data science started to become a more popular term. But now their new tools all have interfaces with R and python as they scramble to stay relevant. I've used SAS for years and it has a lot going for it but it's crazy expensive and much less pleasant to work with compared to R and python. 
There are a few more books listed on the [certification preparation page](https://www.sas.com/en_us/certification/credentials/foundation-tools/clinical-trials-programmer/clinical-trials-programming-accelerated-exam.html) that may be helpful, as well as some sample questions and the exam content guide. The exam content guide gives a good overview of what you'll be tested on. 
I've been using SAS for 7 years and I have to say that it is fantastic for data management. It does leave a lot to be desired for model specification when compared to R however...
Just FYI, this blog was originally posted [here] (https://blogs.sas.com/content/sgf/2018/07/18/sample-text-data/) and was copied to blogspot without attribution. Most likely it was taken down after the author complained to blogspot, but you can still read the original if you're interested.
Thank you for the information. I'm not sure what that tells us about the original poster (to be charitable).
This is definitely true. The only reason I worked with it for years was because the company that employed me at the time (essentially a think tank) had a contract with SAS and we were thoroughly discouraged from using anything else, for pretty much any reason. That pressure was most significant when it was from project managers unfamiliar with data analysis and who were intimidated by the idea of having analysts on the project use anything else. The more data-literate a team was, the less of an issue they'd have with utilizing other software at different times.
Yes this is what I'm trying to do. I want to test for a significant difference for a given surgery type
It's always just infrequent enough that I forget how it works in between. And the data is always just a little different, too. :/
Then all you need to do is a simple proportionality test
It's certainly interesting to compare SAS to python and R. I've found the online community to be far superior for Python for example. I'm an old sob also. Been using SAS since the lat 80s. SAS has a lot of arrogance as a company. It's been really refreshing to see them get kicked in the nuts by open source. The have bet the farm on their sales force and ignored their user community more than they should have. One of my pet peeves are these pretentious 'papers' that they encourage the user community to write. They are set up to appear as though they are scientific papers. Compare that bs to a beautiful Jupyter notebook in github. So why should companies spend a ton of cash and get an inferior product? Which has been more innovative SAS or Python? Which is easier to install? To get documentation? If I want to do text mining I just PIP install the library. For SAS I need to make a business case for an executive primate to sign off and then wait 3 to 6 months. As you can probably tell I could go on and on. 
It's not about being data literate -- it's about having some degree of standardization in your data and code, whether it be SAS or R/Python or anything else. It's a lot easier to hire people who know one or the other than it is to hire people who are proficient in multiple software packages or languages.
I've definitely found their sales force and their client reps to be arrogant and condescending, especially if you write Base SAS code and run in batch. Then they want you to help them create "products" that are usually just a solution in search of a problem. I do think the documentation is pretty accessible nowadays. Since the document went online and become freely available, Google can answer pretty much any question. It's come a long way from flipping through the SAS Language, Procedure, or Macro manuals.
did you try googling? when i google your question, the top hit is a solution to your problem.
Try looking into the various sheet_ options for [ODS EXCEL](http://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=pgmsascdc&amp;cdcVersion=9.4_3.4&amp;docsetId=odsug&amp;docsetTarget=p09n5pw9ol0897n1qe04zeur27rv.htm&amp;locale=en). Chances are there's a way to do what you want.

.sample is not a standard file extension that I know of, so I'd have to open the file and look at it to figure out how to import it. Your if/else statements are syntactically valid but it's hard to say why they might give different results without seeing the other programmer's code.
You need to figure out the delimiter. I assume a .sample file can be opened in a text editor. Is suggest opening it in Notepad++. In N++, select View --&gt; Show Symbol --&gt; Show White Space and Tab. That'll show hidden characters and let you know how it's delimited. the if...then code will work. 
They offer them all the time. Go find/buy some study materials, and schedule it when you can pass the practice exams. How long it will take depends on how much you already know, and how many hours a week you devote to studying, so nobody can really answer that for you.
Look at the prep material, figure out how much material (chapters) you can cover per week and divide by the total material. Took me 3 months but I covered a lot of material. It was covered as part of a masters class, so I also had a bunch of HW though.
It depends on how often you use SAS. If you use SAS often, I would say 1-2 weeks. If you NEVER use SAS, I would say even longer. Go to the [SAS e-Learning page](https://support.sas.com/edu/elearning.html?ctry=us&amp;productType=library) and take the SAS Programming 1 e-Learning. Then, you can either pay for the SAS Programming 2 course or [purchase a book](https://www.amazon.com/SAS-Certification-Prep-Guide-Programming/dp/1607649241) to learn the rest of the material. I also recommend taking the Base SAS Practice Exam as well. 
Thanks, got it working now. Here's the code I used in case anyone wants to copy+change it for their own work: data notesdata\_parsed; rx\_date = prxparse('/\[ \]\\d+\[\\/\]\\d+\[\\/\](2017|2018)\[ \]\\d+\[:\]\\d+\[:\]\\d+( AM -| PM -)/'); set notesdata; where notefield ne ''; do while(1); rx\_pos = prxmatch(rx\_date,notefield ); if rx\_pos = 0 then do; notefield\_new=notefield; output; leave; end; notefield\_new = substr(notefield,1,rx\_pos-1); notefield=substr(notefield,rx\_pos+1); output; end; drop rx\_date notefield rx\_pos; run;
if you’re looking for odds ratios then proc logistic; class surgerytype (ref=‘abdominal’); model survival = surgerytype; run; should work

SAS unit testing is basically the wild wild west, there are 2 different groups of programs that are available for unit testing (SASUnit, FUTS) but I've found them mostly unintuitive especially coming from a language with robust xUnit support. Most SAS programmers rig up their own method of testing.
We use SASUnit
Thanks! I wasn’t aware of SASUnit or FUTS. I’ll look into them. What kind of approaches are you talking about for rigging up one’s own approach?
Thanks! And how is it working for you? Pros/cons?
I know for us most of our systems are structured on a program level, most programs operate on some permanent datasets in a library or database and output some new datasets or edit the original one. these individual units are strung together by a driver that is a glorified list of %include()'s. To test usually people write separate programs for each unit that sets up a test dataset, runs the unit, and checks the results.... FUTS provides a macro library that does similar things but I've found it's automation and reporting quite finicky. 
As a python programmer, you may find this interesting: (https://www.sas.com/content/dam/SAS/support/en/sas-global-forum-proceedings/2018/2347-2018.pdf)
SASUnit Dev Company here. We provided a new SASUnit Version this June. Check it out. It’s free and supporting new features for test driven development. [SASUnit V2](https://sourceforge.net/p/sasunit/wiki/Release%20Notes%20Version%202.0/) 
New to SAS, but I'm not seeing how it works. You don't have to define the field? Also is naming the field with the word cumulative in it, what's telling it to add cumulatively?
It's adding the other field to the existing value of the cumulative field for each iteration of the data step. This special syntax also automatically invokes "retain."
It has greatly improved the release quality of our projects. It's all run by team city on code check-in to alert the devs if anything isn't working as expected. 
It depends on your starting point? Do you already know some SAS? If not, have you worked with data using other software? Do you know programming in general? 
This is what we do, too. For development, put code in bite-sized pieces within separate programs in enterprise guide, perhaps assigned to different process flows. Run single code or process flow to check results for each step. Alternatively, put code in macro containers and call the macros we want in an execute script either all at once or one at a time, depending on development progress. During productionalization (unix based), run driver via gsubmit with include statements that string together parameters/libraries/macro vars with the individual code or macro exection script(s).
I know R and python. 
Recently certified person here. I used SAS at work every day, but I found the base exam covered a very tiny portion of what I did at work. I studied the Ron Cody book diligently every day for a month, and I cracked it in 1 go. I also took a practice test \~1 week before the test.
2nd this. Pay for the exam on the SAS website, it is very close to the real thing.
This looks really interesting. Does this also work in a remote server environment? It looks like its intended to run on the client machine where SAS server, and EG re running. I’m on a windows client running EG with a remote SAS server and no admin privs on said server. Could get IT to installed on server if necessary, but it’s a lengthy process to do so.
I love this paper! SAS has been making efforts to play nice with other data science tools, which is great. I did get some of this stuff running with my client/server configuration and it’s not bad.
Add notab before your ; and see if that fixes it.
[Worth a read](https://blogs.sas.com/content/sasdummy/2014/10/14/dde-is-doa/)
Virtualization will inherently reduce the processing power (your machine will be trying to juggle 2 operating systems at once) and can also add a bit of headache when it comes to managing files between your computer and the virtual one. I've not personally used full SAS on a mac but I have used university edition (which runs on a linux based virtualbox appliance and serves SAS studio to the host OS for IDE and running. It's fine but I've never used it process heavy loads. Another option if you're deadset on a mac is to buy a copy of windows and use bootcamp to boot into windows 10. The downside is that you have to restart your computer every time you want to switch between windows and mac but your RAM and your processor will be fully devoted to whichever OS you're running. 
Thanks for your help. It seems going with a windows based computer is going to be my best bet at this point. I would love to get a mac but I wouldn't love dealing with all the headache. Thanks again!
Your problem with virtualization is that OSX will take X gigs amount of ram, and then your virtualized OS will also take X gigs of ram (unless it's a super lightweight Unix/Linux based one). Running a windows VM inside your OSX would realistically eat up another 4 gig of ram by itself. I'd recommend dual booting over virtualization for your use case. Coincidentally, if there's nothing that is inherent to OSX that you absolutely must use (other software that you only have for Mac), you could just buy a windows laptop. The surface line is pretty nice.
You're absolutely right. I have a surface pro now, but with only 4gb RAM. Looks like I'm sticking with windows. 
If you want to go absolute workaround with it and you're typically in situations with internet - you could put SAS on a home desktop if it's beefy enough, and remote in to that desktop to do your work. You could continue to use your existing laptop and leverage the existing resources if you have them. Something like Chrome Remote Desktop is easy to enable and works pretty painlessly. 
The biggest advantage is that it makes money for Imarticus Learning: "Imarticus Learning is becoming very sought after for their tailor made, industry relevant training programs." As an added bonus, it makes money for SAS when people with little to no experience spend hours studying test questions instead of practicing writing and running code.
Probably one that isn't full of spam.
This fragment at the end of the article really drives home the "we have no passion for this and spent the minimum amount of effort putting this together" point: "While very few institutes are able to strike a balance between all of these factors, that make for a good SAS course."
And it's been online for almost two years without being corrected.
Yes. Sadly, it has a stranglehold on a lot of industries due to the proprietary nature of the actual sas files and their almost cancerous usage across vendors....but Python has libraries that read them reliably (in my experience) and R also has a library that reads them pretty reliably (I noticed issues with it, but nothing too major). There also, I know in my industry at least, is so much legacy coding that would be so much work to redo in open source languages that it'll be around awhile even though there are legitimate (free) alternatives now...just because a lot of that has to be very heavily tested, and there's a general 'if it ain't broke' attitude...so they just opt to pay the insane license fees long term instead of taking a hit on man hours and money now and never paying it again. I'm SAS certified and I avoid using SAS whenever possible. I do not agree with their business tactics. If the language was so great they wouldn't need to lock down files so harshly, people would just opt to pay for your language without being forced to due to standards and their first mover advantage and time already invested in it. There's also the common thought that open source languages can't possibly be trusted because the people that usually make those decisions don't know anything about open source technology and assume something along the lines of 'this costs money so it's clearly better than some free software'. Those people will be dead in another 10-20 years for the most part though. This whole message comes across way more hateful than I intended but I can't find any statements I made here that I disagree with or would word differently.
Hate speech against software is okay in my book ;) It’s just that I am looking to get SAS certified but am wondering how much time and energy I should spend using SAS. I’m a student BTW. And I guess the answer would be “as little as you can”
Correct. Know it but don't take it as the gospel. It's a really, overly, specific programming language and the latest versions are being geared to people with just mild technical skills, able to navigate menus and have a basic data structure understanding...granted, the coding is still available but that doesn't seem to be their focus. I give SAS another decade before we even begin to see it starting to be phased out with any kind of spread though, so, know it. Be able to say and prove you know it. Suggest alternatives whenever possible for any projects once you land a job.
 I don't know your analysis requirements and data set specs, but have you profiled your code performance and attempted to tune/make more efficient your programs?
I haven't yet. I'm just starting out on SAS. I'm sure this will help processing time but since my computer only has 4gb of RAM, I think the first step is getting a computer that has more power. 
That's a good question. I'm not sure, but I will look into it that would definitely be a cheaper option. 
If you want employers to take you seriously, it's after you have 3 - 5 years of SAS programming experience.
Are you trying to write code to interact with the data? You can certainly do that in EG, or you can use the GUIs in EG if you're familiar with them. If you've been going through guides on EG, you can probably do that. But my personal opinion is that the GUIs are the most unintuitive piece of confusion I've ever seen.
&gt; SQL is multi threaded, data step is not Citation please? That might be true for pass-through queries to particular databases, but I'm not sure about `proc sql` itself. Otherwise I agree - for anything that depends on existing row order rather than sort order, data steps are usually simpler. I would go with whatever gives you code that is maintainable and adequately fast. SQL scores some major bonus points on that front because far more people are familiar with it.
Window functions is tsql will get you first and last of a group. Window functions I find to be super useful because you can aggregate on different levels in a single query.
Citation here: https://books.google.at/books?id=wB9cR2iSOYgC&amp;pg=PA454&amp;lpg=PA454&amp;dq=sas+sql+multi+threaded&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FA3HGeP-7E&amp;sig=PxiTy3lNiJB7G48IwJ6Rz7THIj4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjN_5Oc2NfcAhWOZlAKHY6dABgQ6AEwCXoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sas%20sql%20multi%20threaded&amp;f=false
Generally, data step processing is going to be faster but it depends on what you're doing. I like joining with SQL better because you don't have to sort first, and the syntax looks cleaner imo. But if you're not moving tons of data, a lot of it boils down to personal preference. There is a good SAS paper on this: http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/sugi29/269-29.pdf In regards to your second question - SAS is a statistical tool, SQL is a querying tool. Generally speaking, if you're looking for basic queries and data restructuring, tsql might work a lot better (faster) because it has native processing in the database. If you need to make graphs, or build a predictive model, or even just do basic things like means and correlations - SAS is 10000x better. That's all baked in with its procs. That being said - SAS might be better for him because he knows the language. So for him, familiarity and ease of use make it a better tool. That's obviously not an objective advantage, but it makes heck of a difference to the individual using it.
Your link doesn't work for me, I'm afraid, but I was able to verify your claim elsewhere, at least to the extent that it supports threading to some extent. That makes sense for queries involving sorting, but I would be surprised if threading gives the same sort of performance gain for queries that don't involve sorting. 
The critical thing for me is PROC SQL supports explicit passthrough to the database and the DATA step does not, so PROC SQL has a massive advantage when interacting with databases. If things are in the SAS realm then the conscientious DATA step programmer will generally be able to match or exceed PROC SQL performance with the right techniques, but possibly at the cost of higher development time. And of course PROC DS2 is intended to provide something of the best of both worlds.
I don't remember to which extent it supports multi threading, but this fact stuck with me. Proc sort is also multi threaded. With proc ds2, this can be done also: you basically split the input in chunks and process each chunk with same code in parallel. Forgot how this exactly affects things like *by* statement first.var... But it should be faster given that I/o can feed the cores.
While from a syntax standpoint it can look cleaner (I'm a fan of code that is 'readable' by the layman and SQL is usually quite obvious) it doesn't necessarily run faster than sorting and merging and often behind the scenes this is exactly what the SQL join does. See [here](http://support.sas.com/techsup/technote/ts553.html) for more info (bit of a rabbit hole...) Depending on what you're doing and how often you'll need to join things from a particular table you can take advantages of indexes or formats to join data more quickly. If you find that a lot of the time you merge on a variable which is then used in the class statement of a summary then you can combine this into one using the following syntax `proc summary missing nway data = DataFile ;` `class SomeVariable ;` `format SomeVariable FormatName. ;` `var Spend ;` `output out = SpendByVar (drop = _:) sum= ;` `run ;`
&gt; I like joining with SQL better because you don't have to sort first You see this claim get repeated all over the place, and it's incredibly misleading. It's true in the most literal sense that you don't need a PROC SORT before joining in a PROC SQL statement. That said, there's no such thing as a free lunch. PROC SQL has sort routines built into it when joining. There is no magical way PROC SQL knows how to join tables together without sorting - it's just happening behind the scenes. 
It's really not misleading... regardless of what happens under the hood, it's less code to write.
I'm not going to waste time arguing semantics with you. When you say you don't need to sort data before joining using PROC SQL, it heavily implies that the data is joined without being sorted. That is not true. That statement obfuscates how the data is processed. I really don't see how a reasonable person could see what you said as anything but misleading. Less code to write is a shifting of the goalposts and you know it. I'm sure you have some pretzel logic justification for why you're right and I'm wrong, but save yourself the trouble of writing it. I won't read it, and I don't care.
I'm actually not going to argue with you, but I think you need to evalute why you're getting so worked up about some random person from the internet's coding preferences. Here is a picture of a [very nice cat in a bowtie](https://imgur.com/gallery/mVQvKkg), and maybe that will make you a little less angry :)
I can test this tomorrow, but off the toptop of my head replace VARIABLE_&amp;code with call symputx. You are still going to run into the issue that the loop will only run the amount of words in the string and not 5 times to test. May need a %if somewhere for a conditional test. 
Your macro will execute once -- not once each time your data step iterates. You should be able to accomplish what you want without any macros at all.
Not to sort of put a dampener on your learning, but have you looked into building matrices? SAS has lot of this capability built in.
For someone *newish* to SAS you are doing a pretty good job. I could be lazy, but my preference would be to skip using a macro in this instance and just kick it old school. Something like this: data Input(drop=count); length flag $4; input Variable_source $15.; recno = _N_; count = 0; do until(flag=' '); count = count + 1; flag = scan(Variable_source, count); x = 1; if (anyalnum(flag) &gt; 0) then output; end; datalines; 01 03 01 03 04 01 05 01 02 ; run; proc transpose data=Input out=Output(drop=recno _name_) prefix=Variable_; by recno; var x; id flag; run; proc print; run;
Also, in case you're wondering why it's not working - you're mixing up the macro processing time and the PDV initialization. Basically, you can't access the data in your countw function, because the macro is resolved before the data is read. You CAN kick things out of data step processing into the macro processor through call symput(), but those can't be used in the same data step. This problem *can* still be solved in the macro language, but you really don't need to, as explained below, unless you need this to be really flexible.
WaitingForEmacs had it right, the two-digit codes are more or less junk data. Its coming from a survey platform that outputs its multi-select items as one string in that form. We'd rather use flags for each selection though. The item i'm looking at has options 01...09. And creating SAS code to just create flags for this item is easy. But I was looking to make it universally run for any item's option codes. Regardless, thanks for the help! have an upvote!
Thanks again for the advice! After the original post, I tweaked the code a bit more and used symput just like you suggested and I was able to bring in the strings I wanted... but the order of operations was still messed up. The output was just producing one flag variable with all cases flagged as one. %macro parse2; if index(variable_source,%str(&amp;temp)) &gt; 0 THEN Variable_&amp;temp = 1; else Variable_&amp;temp = 0; %mend; data output; set Input; do i = 1 to 1; code = scan(variable_source, i, ' '); call symput('temp', code); %parse2; end; run;
Ha! I remember finding Mojo’s first album with Skid Roper back in the mid-80s in the “new music” stack of our college radio station. I meant to play one song and ended up playing the whole first side (back in the day when it still meant queuing up vinyl by ear). 
if you're saving the dataset to a non work library, i like to open another session of sas and check the file size and see if it's getting bigger. 
Generally, SAS will error out if it runs out of space either in memory or on disk. What kind of analysis are you running, can you share some of your code?
proc contents, proc means, and a couple of proc SQL to generate tables Each table has about 65 variables. It's all hospital data, nothing fancy.
The permanent data sets a have working copies in the work folder. But in Windows explorer, they don't seem to be changing at all.
In your situation I would be tempted to run it interactively so that you can monitor the progress of in the log. Then when you know which step is the bottleneck you can work specifically on optimizing that part. 
Cool, I happened to do this earlier. And to answer my own question, it took 29 minutes of real time to run the biggest DATA step. Then it balked on the merge because I had something wonky with some variables. SAS choked. So now I gotta go back and fix the smaller data table (which is a composite of about a dozen large, slightly defective Excel sheets).
If you are doing a proc sql on a 10gb dataset it doesnt surprise me that its taking 30 mins +. Also proc sqls eat up your memory so if youre close to full it could be an issue. Ive had to resort to data step merges instead in some cases but then the proc sort of course will take very long.
Happens to all of us. I had a program that typically takes an hour to run brick on the second-last line because I forgot a comma...
Does proc sql still eat memory if one is dilligent about dropping tables as they aren't needed? 
Definitely, but I was moreso talking about single joins.
I use SAS daily for my job. I find it to be a pretty nice language with a lot of flexibility but I have 3+ years experience. First year was definitely tough. My job regularly involves dealing with data that is 100+ mil observations and sometime 1 bil+. Genuinely asking - can R or Python reasonably handle those sizes? I do plan on learning R or python in my spare time as I definitely agree that future SAS prospects look diminishing, and are not in industries I want to move into.
I work on data science infrastructure at a university, and basically I have three or four classes of users. 1. Teachers who are teaching data science for researchers who need R, python and want a small hadoop cluster. 2. Graduate students and postdocs who are looking for something to handle their data at scale, these researchers are small in number, but influential because they bring in the bux. 3. A class of research scientist who is on the cusp of new things, but they are happy with linux, python and SAS. Jupyter hub and our HPC cluster is a pretty cool thing for them, because they are using HTC, not HPC. 4. Formally trained statisticians from between 5 and 20 years ago, who live SAS, who love SAS, and all they want are SAS on windows. Moving to linux, or R, or python is just anathema. It's what they know, and they have no desire to change, even though we know they are probably taking a 20-30% performance hit, not because of SAS, but because of Windows.
Python absolutely can. R is a trickier question as the answer would involve servers or other implementations outside of just having a local install. But then again, I'm assuming that most places you're using very large datasets in SAS youre on a server with SAS eg anyway. Given what I said, my general preference is R for most work though. If youre working locally with data, odds are Python or R can easily do what youre asking.
I am intrigued by your first two points and have a lot to learn there. I am skeptical of your last point. I dont believe you have serious people. At the same time, you might as well be talking about people who use RATS. As in, they use it, but that doesnt mean it has a future.
Every language is tough at first. But if you spent 3 years on it you might like it. SAS isn’t always consistent since different programmers/employees create different packages. For instance options are executed differently for different procedures. Even though the same is true in R but it still is more consistent than SAS since it is really a more full blown programming language. I feel like two big reasons that SAS is still widely used are 1) because it is so embedded (people have years and years of experience with it. 2) high security industries feel safe with SAS and I really don’t know the intricacies of buying a corporate SAS contract but I’m sure they afford you some sort of data security. Which allows highly regulated industries like healthcare and finance to shift some of the liability to SAS security. This shifting in liability is impossible with open source languages. Of course companies buy their own third party cyber security contests when they use open source. 
I mean, no.
Oh, these are serious people. They have jobs in a health and statistics related field of some kind and they are mostly answering qustions related to some sort of population study via EHR or insurance claims data. We gobs of them here. 
Honestly you just validated everything I said. They might as well be actuaries, who for some reason are stuck in excel and vba 
Seems like you might be experiencing some confirmation bias. 
I work in the pharma industry as a statistical programmer. This is one of the main industries where SAS is fairly deeply entrenched. Mostly it boils down to this: 1) Inertia. This, to me is the biggest. It's what companies are used to and there is little impetus for them to change. The statisticians and programmers that work in the industry have used SAS throughout all of their careers and it's tough to change direction. 2) Easier to validate. The FDA requires that any software used to run analysis be fully validated. This is easier to do in a closed environment like SAS but trickier in R and Python. That being said, it's not impossible, just trickier. 3) Someone to blame. Open source can still be a "bogey man" sort of word to companies. If something goes wrong, they want someone to blame. SAS provides that, R doesn't. (Keep in mind, I don't believe this, it's just a hurdle I've seen). Now you've probably noticed that all of these reasons deal with outside influences, not with the actual language itself. That's because I, personally, think there is minimal that makes SAS a better language. There is a lot you can do in SAS and it's a powerful tool, but I would never say it's better than R or Python. So to answer your question: what makes SAS worth my time? Are you interested in programming in the pharmaceutical industry? Programming for FDA submissions? SAS is for you (based on the above reasons). If not, then I got nothing for you.
Yeah you obviously didn’t as a “serious” or “earnest” question. Just face it. 
I asked for answers that were real. Not generic, useless garbage. Nothing here has been true so far, beyond it being legacy software. Why would it be good for someone top learn SAS? What advantage does it provide? Why will it last? Questions no SAS user has answered for years, for good reason. They can''t
That was a reasonable answer. That said, it doesnt make me think SAS will last he decade.
I work in one of the leading CROs. I can see SAS starting to taper off in about a decade. It won't be gone though. It probably won't be gone in our lifetimes. Look at COBOL.
If Excel is the right tool for a particular task, use Excel. No tool is the best solution for every possible situation.
Agreed 
I've been programming in SAS for the past 20 years in financial services, and it is the best tool for many of my projects. Our company (a big one) has been trying Hadoop for the past few years, and it hasn't gotten past the proof of concept phase. On the other hand, SAS is an efficient, tested solution that performs better now than it ever has in the past on the Grid infrastructure. It sounds like you don't want to learn SAS, which is certainly your prerogative, but I can tell you that I have personally hired about 10 SAS programmers in the past year to lucrative positions. There are plenty of SAS programmers out there, and more people continue to learn it. SAS isn't perfect, but it isn't nearly as bad as you make it out.
That is an interesting perspective, and I have no doubt there are more people like you who are continuing to hire for sas. But what I want to know is, what is the advantage of sas? And why will it continue? I did not ask if you personally use it and propagate its use
I think you’re underestimating it’s entrenchment in pharma. All the big companies staff programmers that do submission work in SAS. They also have large pull over any CROs they use to use SAS. If a person wants to get a role in the industry, they’ll need to learn SAS. Also, while I prefer python and R overall, SAS is more than capable of doing the jobs that the industry requires (basically data manipulation and the creation of tables, listings and figures.). The only real impetus , at the moment, for any shift would be cost, and this isn’t exactly a frugal industry. Could SAS die off in 10 years? I mean sure it’s possible, but that would require a massive shift in the pharma scene. 
That's shortsighted, honestly. Every tool has a function. SAS CAN and DOES handle larger data for our researchers. I have researchers who run 300 GB of data in a single run through it on a regular basis. These ARE serious researchers. I don't know what you mean by serious, to be honest though. Let me put it this way to see why people use SAS. Some researchers are put off by the fact that they don't necessarily know where the algorithms open source developers use for certain statistical work come from, so they would rather use SAS, where they know the algorithm, and that it's not going to change any time soon. If they run a function, they know that function will still have the same code in subsequent iterations. One of the cases where the latest and greatest isn't what they want, they want something that's reliable and tried and true. 
I can’t see SAS dying out in the next decade, definitely continue to decline but it’s very entrenched in banks, insurance and healthcare industries.
Similar to the 'max' suggestion in the other comment, you could look into 'coalescec' which will grab the first non-missing. Another option is simple data step logic like 'if not(missing(ind1)) then prompt=txt1; else if ....' 
I learned SAS first and, when trying to replicate some of my code in Python and R I kept running into cases where I needed to do something... but first I need to install a package. And then in a couple days I'd need to install another package. And another. And sometimes installing the package would fail or it just wouldn't work the way I wanted. I spent half my time in google looking for packages. Beyond the packages I found a lot more comfort in R. The syntax made more intuitive sense to me and I thought RStudio was a lot more stable and aesthetically pleasing. I felt Spyder in comparison was some neckbeard's pet project. But my concern with both is data management. For statistical procedures, I understand why someone would just go to R or Python. Take data and analyze it? Create visualizations? I agree that paying for SAS in this context isn't the direction I'd go if I was a company or student. But a lot of my job is moving data around. My company has shit stored in several different databases. I can take that data and create my own little database that I can run queries against whenever I want. And when I want to pull data, I don't need to import it into my memory first. I can reference data in my work directory or any library I want. I define my library once and can reference any table in that folder for the duration of my session. My table schema is stored in each sas file, ready to go. I know Python and R offer similar functionality regarding storage of formats, but I still have to load each table I need and with Python I have to install a package to do it. If my company said "we're getting rid of SAS", I'd deal with it, get comfortable in R or Python, and would probably be fine. Honestly, with what I do at work, I'd probably look to another solution entirely. Something more data-management-oriented.
Your points about packages are fair - when I teach R, I encourage people to stay away from packages unless there is an obvious long-term advantage, and signs of maintenance (a release within the past year, usually). Learning ggplot or dplyr or shiny is a long-term advantage. Pulling in somebody's package to save yourself an hour of writing an algorithm - not worth the dependency risk. So yeah, totally agree it's easy to end up in a mess of packages. But I consider that kind of like if you learned SAS by %include-ing a ton of other people's half-baked macros with inconsistent parameter names. Stay close to the base language and high-profile, widely-used packages whenever possible and I think you'll have a better experience.

I would suggest using a couple of arrays plus a do loop for this.
 data work.want (keep = ID Day Prompt); set work.have; array txtprompt(*) txt1-txt300; do x = 1 to dim(txtprompt); if txtprompt(x) ^= '' then do; prompt = txtprompt(X); output; end; end; run;
To further add onto this, I think that the rise in popularity of R and Python in data science doesn't necessarily imply a decline for SAS since data science as a whole is booming right now. Sure, percent wise, they may have less of a market share, but I'd be interested to see what the number of SAS users actually looks like from year to year.
This is the correct way to solve this problem. I would use "\d{5}" instead of "\d\d\d\d\d", but they are the same thing. Here is a website to test out regular expressions on test data before you use them in SAS code - https://regex101.com/ 
&gt; numberstring = substr(fileloc,prxmatch("\d\d\d\d\d", fileloc),5); Reddit is evil with regards to SAS code. It kept erroring and erroring until I realized SAS eats slashes. 
I work as a statistical programmer in the pharma CRO industry (my first "programming" job out of college). Every Biostatistics department I've heard of uses SAS for the reasons already listed by other comments. It does worry me a bit that I've just been programming in SAS for the past year, but there is always talk about SAS being replaced...at least on reddit so I honestly should probably brush up on things such as Python (we mainly used Python and Java in college). Just speaking for the pharma industry though, everything uses SAS...so I can't see it going away anytime soon for pharma CROs.
Maybe not a problem for OP in practice, but I think this won't work as intended if there can be multiple matches, including longer numeric sequences. E.g. from "abc12345def678910" this would pull "67891" (I think the PRX functions are greedy?)
If there are potentially other sequences that are as long or longer than the target sequence, then it's a different problem with a different solution. If there were multiple sequences of 5+ digits, I believe this will just return the first five consecutive digits (I'm not at a SAS machine so I can't check to be sure). If there are no sequences of 5+ digits this will error. `prxmatch` will return 0, and `substr` will give an out of bounds error. If that's possible, OP should save the position from `prxmatch` and then substring only if the position &gt; 0.
Just use a passthru
Yeah, but how? Never done that. 
They have software licenses. People need to update them yearly. Those companies trust SAS. They are not willing to trust free, open-source python packages when they have the money to throw at a SAS License. It's as simple as that my friend.
You can use sas on demand for academics or sas university edition. Both are free and versions of sas studio for the browser.
About 2-3 weeks minimum. Depends on how often u use sas.
....unzip the file, then access it via sas? I feel like a rocket scientist after answering that one.
Your internet sucks? Go to a starbucks or something.
The SAS Documentation page has some pretty good examples, you pretty much write sql native for your dbms and tell SAS to select from that result set, or use it however you want. http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/acreldb/63647/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a003113595.htm Give it a go, and then post if you run into any specific issues.
SAS has some free online [courses](https://support.sas.com/edu/elearning.html?ctry=us&amp;productType=library). Try to get familiar with the basics of SAS macros. Since you know SQL you can lean on that to an extent (see [PROC SQL](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=pgmsascdc&amp;cdcVersion=9.4_3.4&amp;docsetId=sqlproc&amp;docsetTarget=n1oihmdy7om5rmn1aorxui3kxizl.htm&amp;locale=en)). If you haven't already, go ahead and install [SAS University Edition](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html). Good luck!
What'd you put on your resume? If you put "HTML/CSS, Python, R and SQL" and made it through to interviews, it seems the hiring people would have determined that your other experiences indicate you'd be capable of learning SAS and you may be able to round out the team with some other experience (python, R). Take some SAS online classes (you can get SAS university edition for free and follow along). Be honest in your interview of your lack of SAS experience but that you've already taken a weeks worth of training in SAS. If you put "SAS" on your resume but have never used it, then you might be SOL.
I put all of that information on my resume and didn't specifically state I knew SAS. I have a friend who works in that area who states they use it, but it was not listed in the job description.
Thank you!
I suggest you look for a dataset with a basic SAS analysis program done on it, try to understand what each step do. Great thing you already know SQL. Try also to apply what you know in R using sas language. Good luck. 
If it's not in the job description or the qualifications, I wouldn't worry about. And I wouldn't recommend telling anyone that you know SAS after a week of exposure to it.
I am currently interviewing people for a data analyst role, and what you are describing is similar to 90% of my applicants (maybe you are one of them!). In my opinion, being experienced in data manipulation, analytical, and presentation technologies demonstrates the core aptitude. Specific languages are nice to have, and represent a shorter training period, but aren't necessary. For example, we are currently a SAS shop, but I just hired an R analyst and started training them on SAS syntax. I'd encourage you to focus in your interview on what you know inside and out, and demonstrate how you have applied your core knowledge to learn new things. Any interviewer who isn't an idiot will see right through someone who has one week of experience. 
I appreciate your input, xmindallas. I'll just focus on my strengths in the interview and hope for the best!
Thank you for this input! I guess being transparent and honest is hte most important thing. Unfortunantly I am not proficient in much of the languages but know the basics and eager to learn! Hoping for the best :-)

Since no one has mentioned it yet, SQL can be utilized within a SAS environment to do a lot of the data manipulation. You can lean on your SQL knowledge while picking up on the finer points of SAS. All the SAS you need to know to get to SQL is: proc SQL; ~~SQL code ; quit;
Don't worry. Most of the data manipulation could be done in SQL via a proc SQL. Usually,the only thing I don't in SQL is transpose a table. But it is to find how to do it in was. Moreover, if they have selected you for an interview , it seem that you interested them. So no problem you know thing that they want
As long as they dont mean SAS VA or SAS Viya or any of the esoteric SAS packages, you can pick it up the basics in about 48 hours as long as you understand how the oddball MERGE works.
I just got a junior data analyst position which listed SAS in the job description. There was a very brief SAS 'test' as part of the interview, basically handwrite some simple code. However, my interviewer and another employee both stated there have been successful applicants who did not have any SAS experience and wrote nothing on the 'test'. You have other skills, and I assume work experience, so you probably don't need to worry too much. 
If it wasn't in the job description, they might not expect you to know it right now. They might be willing to have you take SAS courses. But if you're interested in learning SAS, my suggestion is getting a copy of Little SAS Book, or look at UCLA's SAS tutorials. You might be able to get a free online version of SAS University to use.
sasensei.com ?
Yes to all. On my phone, but try: Ods Excel file='filepath/name.xlsx'; Proc freq... Tables x / out=tblname; Tables y/out=tblname2; Run; Ods Excel close; You may need to look at the sheetname= option. Or try multiple proc freqs with one tables statement. You should be able to export multiple tables into one sheet. Should be able to run multiple proc prints and change an option so they don't output to different tabs. I'll play around with it tomorrow. 
I'm afraid you just can't learn SAS in a week. To be good at SAS takes years of learning, practice, and experience. You can get started though. 
Can you describe a bit more what you are trying to do?
Just basic rolling window functions. The simplest method so far was just to use a proc sql with a correlated sub query, but I want to know how to do it on a sas way. Like, given a time series, apply a function to the data for an arbitrary window, then proceed for each row. It's very basic. But I want a solution that isn't hacked together hopefully (ie something obviously coherent to others). 
Can you provide a quick data example to make sure I understand? Just show a few rows. Of your data and then what you imagine this function doing and then the result. I think I can provide some guidance on a "non-hacked" solution. 
Just build any data with months as a column. Then a column with any randomly generated numbers as column 2. Then a function that would apply something like mean or standard deviation to the 1 or 5 or x months prior to any given row (ie month). (I'm on my phone so I'm giving anything in table form, hopefully it's such a basic setup that it's not an issue). Basically like rollapply (or a dozen other functions) in R. 
OK. One other question before I answer because I don't want to re-invent the wheel if it already exists. Are you doing some sort of time-series or longitudinal analysis? I ask because SAS ETS has a number of features already built into many of the analyses that will do rolling windows for you (see proc expand for example). Here's a good paper that lists out some of these: [http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/forum2008/093-2008.pdf](http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/forum2008/093-2008.pdf)
Thanks. It looks like this is probably the best sas way I'm going to find to do basic things like this. I'm going to be honest, going from r to sas has been frustrating. 
Just an FYI, if it's easier for you, you can make calls to R from within SAS and pass the results back to SAS. So for example, if you have a function or some lengthy program you have in R and want to pass your SAS dataset to R,have it run your function, and seamlessly pass the data back to SAS, that is easy to do too. SAS takes some time to pick up, but it is extremely powerful and very fast since all the the routes are C-based. If you have other questions, post them here and I can help. Also, I'll whip up a quick data step program for you and post back here shortly to demonstrate one implementation of a rolling window for you (I'll leave the proc expand version alone for now since it's well documented). Also, note that important decisions must be made with regard to how to treat missing values, etc.
I'm going to be honest, it's not about ease. Sas makes me sick to my stomach. I understand that some people like it, and people have different reasons for using it. I just can't stand it. I do appreciate your help though. No need to post anything additional. 
&gt;I'll whip up a quick data step program for you and post back here shortly to demonstrate one implementation of a rolling window for you OK, so I suppose you are trying to do something like this. The first code block is simply me generating some simulated data and storing the data as a dataset (ds1). The second code block sorts the data on the dimensions you intend to summarize by (in this example, "patient" and then "month"). The third code block/line ("%let n = 4") is the "look-back period" or the number of months in your window of analysis. The fourth code block is the meat of the analysis where the analysis is performed by patient (here the lag function is you friend). Each time a new patient is encountered, the counter (count) and num\_sum is set to 0 to reset the statistics. Then a counter is started for each observation as is used as a control variable of sorts. If the the counter is greater than the look-back window (in this case n = 4), the number of interest (num) is is added to the rolling sum stored in num\_sum but we have to subtract the "num" of the current row since the current row will be 1 more month than we want in our sum (hence the -last&amp;n -- we just take the negative of the variable last&amp;n in this case the negative of the variable "last4"). The moving average calculation should be apparent from the code. I hope this helps: `/*create simulated dataset with 3 patients, A, B, and C*/` `data ds1;` `do patient='A','B','C';` `do month=1 to 7;` `num=int(ranuni(0)*10);` `output;` `end;` `end;` `run;` `/*sort dataset by level of summarization*/` `proc sort;` `by patient, month;` `run;` ​ `/*set the lookback period or number of months to lag by*/` `%let n = 4;` ​ `/*compute statistic of interest*/` `data ds2;set ds1;by patient;retain num_sum 0;if first.patient then do;count=0;num_sum=0;end;count+1;` `last&amp;n=lag&amp;n(num);` `if count gt &amp;n then num_sum=sum(num_sum,num,-last&amp;n);` `else num_sum=sum(num_sum,num);` `/*here we compute a moving average, but this can be any statistic*/` `if count ge &amp;n then mov_aver=num_sum/&amp;n;` `else mov_aver=.;` `run;` `/*print results*/` `title 'Moving average within BY-Group';` `proc print;` `run;`
I just ended up putting it in pastebin. See here: https://pastebin.com/VttrEZae 
Understood. It definitely takes some getting used to moving away from R's vector operations to SAS's row operations. Best of luck to you.
To be clear. No. That is not the problem. The problem is it being a bad "language" with limited capabilities and being years if not decades behind everything else. You might as well still be using telnet. I am sorry for saying all this. 
You don't have to apologize to me - I have no affiliation with SAS. I uses SAS, R, Python, C, C++, and a whole host of other languages. Each has their pros and cons. I'm curious why you'd say it's years behind other languages? Just because you struggle with the language doesn't mean it's a poor language for statistical analysis. 
It is not just pharma. The U.S. government agency that my company contracts with uses SAS, so the work is done with SAS and likely will be for many years to come. I also agree that SAS is better for making tables and plotting in SAS is almost as good as R at this point. That said, if the work starts to get more complex with simulations, Bayesian analyses, and specialized predictive analytics, where user defined functions are needed to keep code understandable and maintainable, I think Python or R will start to be incorporated. 
No, you will not be able to 'pick it up quickly'. Stop lying to employers.
Can you provide more context? What this line evaluates to is: * an empty string if the CSR1 date is greater than the end date * a single character string with asterisk if CSR1 date is not greater than the end date But without some additional context it is hard to tell how this value is used and or ignored later. 
Sure. It’s creating a grouping variable that’s used as a flag for processing down the line. If I’m understanding what you wrote it is simply saying that if csr1date is greater than or equal to end date then set the value of csrgrp1 (I did not include this in my original message) to blank. Otherwise, set the value of csrgrp1 to *. 
Great! Thanks for the help. Much appreciated.
Hey, thanks for using SAS. :)
We'd need to know the base language that this came from: IF CSR1DATE GE ENDD THEN ‘ ‘ ELSE ‘*’; But my hunch is that this is likely going to translate to: if CSR1DATE GE ENDD THEN CSR1DATE = " "; else CSR1DATE="*"; But there are better ways of handling this is SAS because CSR1DATE and ENDD should probably be stored as SAS DATES, so it you wouldn't be able to store a string into them. Instead, you'd use some syntax like this: IF CSR1DATE gt ENDD THEN newvar=""; ELSE newvar="*"; Taking this a bit further, if you are really trying to perform some grouping, I suspect that there are much better and more efficient grouping methods available in SAS to accomplish what you are trying to do, but without context, we're kind of shooting in the dark.
Without meaning to be rude, you really need to have these things edited if you want to use this blog to market yourself. This was pretty painful to read.
Think of libname as a specific folder that contains all of your dataset or files. Filename refers to a very specific output document from your program. 
Please take this as constructive criticism. I don't mean anything negative by it, I just think most of the questions are confusingly worded or too open ended. 1) Characterize the fundamental structure of SAS programming? To get at the answer you're looking for. I think it would be better to say "What are the elements of the SAS environment?" or something similar. The way the question is now is very open to interpretation. I could easily see someone answering "procedures and data steps" 4) What is the role of the output statement in a SAS Program? You should specify that you are referring to "output" as it is used in procedures since output in the data step has a different function. 7) Clarify how the SAS program can be debugged and tested? This question is very open ended compared to the answer you suggest. 8) What is the SAS information? Based on the answer should the question be "What are SAS informats and how are they used?" 9) Describe what SAS functions do you use to check data approval and errors? I would be more careful about the use of the word functions. Functions, to me, are mostly exclusive to the data step. Things like missing(), sum(), etc. The answer you provide refers to both SAS procedures and the SAS Log. There's more that needs to be looked at but hopefully that gives you a place to start. Also, definitely heed /u/Ecopath 's advice to perform some editing as it can be very confusing to read.
Here are some new features in SAS/Graph: [http://robslink.com/SAS/democd30/new\_92\_sas.htm](http://robslink.com/SAS/democd30/new_92_sas.htm) [http://robslink.com/SAS/democd50/new\_93\_sas.htm](http://robslink.com/SAS/democd50/new_93_sas.htm) [http://robslink.com/SAS/democd62/new\_94\_sas.htm](http://robslink.com/SAS/democd62/new_94_sas.htm) &amp;#x200B;
libname can also point to things that aren't folders, like databases.
You're way too kind to spell this out. This set of questions demonstrates that the author knows absolutely nothing about SAS. Errors like using "data set" and "data index" synonymously and asking questions as if SAS interactive and EG are the only way to run code are tip-offs. I can't imagine anyone being able to successfully guess the answers to these questions.
In a corporate environment, there's no reason for SAS users to worry about installation. And if someone can program in Base SAS and has experience relevant to the job, they can learn how all the pretty bells and whistles work in short order. I can imagine being in a much bigger fix if someone could run Enterprise Miner but knew nothing about data steps.
Your last statement I agree with, the rest not by a long shot. More time is wasted because some self proclaimed "advanced SAS" user has no concept of metadata management, clueless as to the relationship between LIBNAME and where the data is stored. As for learning the bells and whistles, sure a few PROCs can be picked up easy by someone with Base SAS, but there is so much more to the SAS ecosystem that maybe expected of a candidate that they should be aware of before going in cold. My point is the questions on here are things that anyone involved with SAS should be all over, these are not things that would be considered "tricky" or used to probe for experience in SAS. 
I'm not implying that those questions are good, relevant, or clear in any way. I use a much better set of questions to determine whether someone is an effective Base SAS programmer -- I don't trust self-proclamations at all. My questions aren't tricky either, but they go to how an actual programmer thinks and whether they know what they're doing. Libnames and procs aren't "bells and whistles" at all. But knowing all of the details about Viya or memorizing all of the screens in Enterprise Miner are. Of course I wouldn't hire someone as a model developer if they have no statistical background (eMiner knowledge or no), but I'd certainly hire an analyst for their excellent Base SAS skills alone. Even if my team used EG exclusively and they had done all their work in batch, it wouldn't deter me from hiring them in the least.
ODS Excel is very nice and is only available in 9.4m3 or later. 
And you also have to remember that SAS's sql implementation is not ANSI compliant.
I agree completely. Especially the part about "how a programmer thimks" which is why the debugging question posed by OP has a rather weak answer. But Base SAS alone, while good, is still just the tip of the iceberg in modern SAS experience expectations. 
"at the most basic level."
My group may not be "modern" in your estimation, but we have some batch jobs that we run, and we do some data exploration in EG. For our team, Base SAS is the whole iceberg. Even if someone has never touched EG, I can teach them that in an hour.

thank you!
The distinction between a character or numeric informat is whether or not it has a "$" in front of it. I'm not following your type I and J example. Could you please share the exact code that you're running?
Replying using my other account on PC. I followed the steps outline in this [paper](http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/forum2007/068-2007.pdf) when creating the informat from a SAS dataset. On page 2, there is a table where you can define the type of format/informat , can be character or numeric depending on the type. So in that table, type J is for character informat and type I is for numeric informat. I pull the start (character variable) and label (numeric variable) values from a dataset. To create the format I ran the sample code. data work.testformat; set work.source (rename = (charvar = start numvar = label)); fmtname = 'informatname'; retain type "I" hlo " "; run; proc format cntlin = work.testformat; *Testing the informat; data test; a='ABC' b=input(a,informatname.); run; When I ran above code, I get my desired output, which is convert variable a to a numeric output based from informatname. Running the same code, but updating type column to J, I also get my desired output, which is convert variable a to a numeric output based from informatname, even without using a $ sign upon calling it. Hope this makes sense.
So, I managed to make the changes I needed, but still trying to figure out the reason why the space is added after the ")" and the (-1) I'm guessing to remove that space. The change I made was removing that space for &amp;temp "%trim(%bquote(&amp;&amp;lbl&amp;numvars))" \&amp;temp; and &amp;temp "%trim(&amp;&amp;name&amp;numvars)" &amp;temp ; &amp;#x200B; and also using %else %let temp=; instead of %else %let temp=' ';
Proc compare
Could you provide an example dataset? This is a question that would have answers vary depending on the context. Is it one long dataset where new observations are appended on? Is this multiple datasets you are trying to compare? Can we assume that each ID will have new data added at specific intervals?
Thanks! I'm missing something. Libname xyz is that creating a temporary library elsewhere? I'm not able to reference it in the set statement. 
😵😵 this is absolutely correct. Thank you thank you thank you
It's one long dataset with millions of records. how would you suggest I upload an example dataset? Ideally what I would like to do is compare the same policy numbers against past periods (say 1 record every 12 months or 6 months based on policy duration, and dataset covers 4 yrs of data) and see whether a value in a specific column has changed.
Proc SQL can do this very quickly.
How do I create a dummied table? or is it all formatting? Your table is pretty close to what I'm trying to describe. I.e. comparing records with the same 'ID' to see if 'Value' has changed, if yes(i.e. ID 2 has changed from 20 to 21, and ID 3 has changed from 1 to 3) I'd like to either flag it with a N/Y flag or maybe a small description/band.
The easiest way to do the dummied data is to write it out in a either SAS or notepad (that way you can enter the tabs). Then copy and paste it into reddit. Finally, select the data and click the "code" button (looks like &lt;&gt;) For a solution, I think using a mixture of "first" and the lag function would achieve what you want. data youhave; input id date value; informat date DATE9.; format date DATE9.; datalines; 1 06AUG2012 10 1 06FEB2013 10 1 06JUN2013 10 2 06NOV2012 20 2 06JAN2013 21 2 12JUL2013 21 3 01FEB2013 1 3 02APR2013 1 3 10OCT2013 3 ; run; proc sort data=youhave; by id date; run; data youwant; length valflag $1; set youhave; by id date; lastval=lag(value); if ^first.id AND value^=lastval then valflag="Y"; else valflag="N"; run;
Thanks, will give it a try!
Thanks! will give this a try as well!
Is it possible that those are tabs between the fields and not spaces? If you arrow through the file in Notepad, does your cursor jump?
Yes! So it does matter if you set tab or blank space as you delineator ?
Yes. Try it with tab and see if that gets you closer.
Thanks for the heads up. I'll amend the program and compare the results to see if outputs are same
Is it because the "\" shouldn't be in generic\_drug? data ph2; set ph; if Generic_Drug &lt;112200 or Generic_Drug=112288 then do; drug_type='O'; drug_gen = generic_drug; end; else do; drug_type='N'; if generic_drug GE 112200 or Generic_Drug LE 112558 then drug_gen = generic_drug; else drug_gen = 1; end; run;
also mixing character and numeric values for drug_gen ("O" and 1), not sure if that's going to fuck you. 
&gt; PS - why won't backslach characters appear in my post? Anyone? It's because backslash is an escape character for reddit. I believe that in order to make a backslash appear you need to have two back to back. So if I type a single backslash it'll look like this: \ If I type a double backslash it looks like this: \\
&gt; PS - why won't backslach characters appear in my post? Anyone? It's due to backslash being an escape character. Specifically, the issue here is that "\_" is used in reddit for italics _like so_. In order to make it appear you need to have three backslashes so that it appears \\\_ The first backslash is to escape the second backslash. The third backslash is to escape the underscore. 
Weird, there are no backslashes in my actual code. Guess they appeared when I copy pasted it here.
The code values for the drugs are pretty long. I want to retain drug codes between 11200 and 112558. Am I being stupid haha? 
You sir/madam, were correct. I was being a fool. OR vs AND /facepalm. 
 You sir/madam, were correct. I was being a fool. OR vs AND /facepalm. 
We all do that sometimes. That is why a second look by someone else is so valuable.
Datepart http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrdict/64316/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a000245883.htm
This is the correct answer if you want to convert it to a date variable - however, try `intnx` if you want to leave it as a datetime variable and truncate it to midnight.
Okay thanks I’ll try😀😀
I believe you want the `group= option `. Are you using `proc sgplot`?
I'm not sure, but if I do, how could I use it?
Never mind, I figured it out! I used PROC SGPLOT and then scatter x = (name) y = (name) / group = (name)
That article has two things in it that represent what really irks me about SAS.... "... instead of relying on a batch SAS program to push content into Excel..." " [You can use Office scripting to automate the process](http://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings11/012-2011.pdf) (like a batch job) ..." It seems like there has been a deliberate move by SAS to push us away from the traditional SAS batch job into all these GUI interfaces instead. And when pressed for how to recreate the batch job experience you get directed to a far more complicated method. 
This is a situation where there are several ways you could accomplish the same outcome. Your way works, though there is only really a need to check the 'Y' criteria. A fun way to do it would be to concatenate the variables into a string and then use index. length allvar $50; allvar=catx(",",of _ch{*}); if index(upcase(allvar),"Y")&gt;0 then comorbid=1; else comorbid=0; 
Thanks for the tip. :) 
I once had a similar issue, and solved it using proc gplot with a bubble graph, if you google it, there are some nice examples: http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/graphref/63022/HTML/default/viewer.htm#gplot-bubble.htm 
Here are some nice examples and codes https://support.sas.com/sassamples/graphgallery/PROC_GPLOT_Graph_Types_Plots_Bubble.html
Highly appreciate this. Thanks
&gt;rience in other programming languages and still use sas because it's one tool in my toolkit, if it's building an etl to the sas environment then yeah I will use it. If it's something systems related, bash or ansible, just choose the right one for the right scenario. &amp;#x200B;
&gt;I think you’re underestimating it’s entrenchment in pharma. No doubt. I am especially thinking of Pfizer with their Clinical Development Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS) that is totally built around SAS. 
It would be good to learn R, but change will come very slowly because many processes are built around the SAS tools. In the past I worked at a CRO that kept SAS 8.2 going on a VAX server long after version 9 was the norm simply because updating meant redoing many processes.
array count\_op (\*) d\_op1-d\_op14; do p = 1 to dim(count\_op); if count\_op(p) &lt; 0 then pre\_op = 1; else pre\_op = 0; if count\_op(p) = 1 then day\_of\_op = 1; else day\_of\_op = 0; if count\_op(p) = 0 then post\_op = 1; else post\_op = 0;end; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; day\_of\_op post\_op; do p = 1 to 14; if .&lt; and &lt;0 in count\_op then pre\_op=1; \*\*pre-surg; else pre\_op = 0; if 0 in count\_op then day\_of\_op=1; \*\*day of surg; else day\_of\_op = 0; if &gt;0 in count\_op then post\_op=1; \*\*post\_surg; else post\_op = 0; end;
As you've got the data in an array, you can use the min() / max() function on the entire array by using the "of array{\*}" syntax. &amp;#x200B; `pre_op = (. &lt; min(of count_op{*}) &lt; 0) ; /* returns 1 if any value &lt; 0, excluding missing (i think) */` `post_op = (max(of count_op{*}) &gt; 0) ; /* returns 1 if any value &gt; 0 */` `day_of_op = not pre_op and not_post_op and nmiss(of count_op{*}) &lt; dim(count_op) ; /* not pre or post, and at least 1 value is populated */` &amp;#x200B;
You could do it as a proc sql step joining on whatever field is required 
Thanks! Appreciate the the detailed approach. 
This is my first time doing a KM curve for work I'm looking at EndStage Heart Failure and the question is "5&amp; 10 year survival" I've made the curve, but I'm massively paranoid I've done it all wrong. Am I suppose to stratify it by a variable if I'm not giving one? I'd Just like to double check with someone who is more familiar. Here are some of my variables: Name Gender DoB Death=1/Alive=0 (renamed as "STATUS" Date of last visit Date of Death FU time to end stage HF Time of Follow up or to Death (renamed this as "TOTAL_FU" --and used this as my time variable) Etc., Etc., My code is as follows: libname XXX "\\tuftsmc\home\hpatel3\SAS Datasets"; run; proc import out=XXX.ES_databasedatafile="\\tuftsmc\home\XXX\SAS Datasets\ES Database Edit.csv" dbms=csvreplace; getnames=yes; datarow=2; run; ods graphics on; proc lifetest data=XXX.ES_databaseconftype=loglog plot=(s) plots=(survival(atrisk=0 to 10 by 5 test)); time FU_ES*Status(0); survival out=survci; Title " 5 &amp; 10 year Survival for ES"; run; Thanks in advanced! 
You can use STRATA statement if you want to compare curves between different categories of variables. If not asked then I don't think it's necessary. Also a minor comment that you can also consider "CONFTYPE=ASINSQRT" as your choice of confidence interval. The arc-sine square root transformation is a little more conservative and won't exceed the boundary of [0,1], which is more realistic.
If you ever go on one, or even do the online self-taught ones, you will soon see why. You get what you pay for.
I will echo this sentiment. In addition there are some basic courses like SAS programming 101 that are available for free. And Coursera also has some content available https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-visualization/sas-lesson-1-defining-exploratory-data-analysis-qMoBp 
Depending on just how creative the formatting is you may be able to use the [xlsx libname engine] (https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=pgmsascdc&amp;cdcVersion=9.4_3.4&amp;docsetId=acpcref&amp;docsetTarget=n0oj9f6i838mymn148890ckla700.htm&amp;locale=en#p0za68meaywctcn1d4y4up68omcm) and a data step to get what you want. Once you set it up you reference a worksheet like it were a SAS dataset. If that doesn't work you may try saving each table as a CSV from excel and then you can read it with the input statement syntax you're familiar with.
I know right. And why do I have to go to the class? Can't they come to my house and teach me? And why should I even have to learn SAS. Can't they just do my job for me?
Maybe because SAS is not open source? And they really don't care if it is popular? They make bank on the consulting services side of things, so there is a vested interest in limiting the number of people who know what they are doing in SAS. It is a strategy to restrict the training classes and make big corps and government toss big money at them for their own internal staff since outside SAS consultants are extremely expensive.
&gt; I was wondering what you think of SAS' business strategy. This comes up from time to time. A few weeks ago someone mentioned that SAS was on its last legs and would not survive much longer. I'm the skeptical sort, so I went to check out their financial statements: &gt; Increased customer demand for artificial intelligence, machine learning, fraud and risk management, and cloud solutions strongly influenced continued revenue growth and profitability for SAS in 2017. The analytics leader posted US$3.24 billion in total operating revenue. [2017 Annual Report | SAS](https://www.sas.com/en_us/company-information/annual-report.html) Now, perhaps I am too easy to impress, but my impression is that a company with over $3 billion a year in revenue, which is privately held, and pouring 26% of revenues back into R&amp;D might just have a sense of what they are doing.
I am guessing it is a missing value. There are actually 28 ways to define a missing numeric value in SAS, the standard "." is just the default. The others are designated with a period and then a letter, or a period and then an underscore. When I worked in survey research we would some times use these different types of missing values to designate why something was missing, and I have sometimes seen it now in lab data for pharma research. To see if this is the case, try.... if smokegroup = .a then smokegroup = 0; [http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrcon/62955/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a000992455.htm](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrcon/62955/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a000992455.htm)
I’m guessing it’s a character variable if it contains an A so you could use tranwrd function to change A to 0 then convert to a numeric. Ex: Input(Tranwrd(variables, “A”, “0”), 1.)
Are there any restrictions like should this be a single data step?
Assuming your data is in an external file you would use an infile statement to read the file, and then an input statement to read the variables. 
In that case you'll have to copy and paste the text from the exercise into your programs and use it with a cards or datalines statement. 
I'm assuming its meant to be done in a single data step but I'm not sure, literally all of the info I'm given is displayed in the image I attached. 
[Reading Raw Data](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrcon/62955/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a003209907.htm) &amp;#x200B; This link should help. In the ***Additional Data-Reading Features*** section on handling "a file with multiple record layouts".
The best way I found to learn was by doing. If you have a project that you've worked on in STATA/R - try to replicate that same project within SAS. Google is your friend. One of the best things about SAS is that it has been around forever. You're most likely not going to be the first person to have the problem you're trying to solve. My background in SAS started with just knowing SQL. If you know that, start there. Then build as you come across new problems. The concepts you've used in STATA/R will be the same concepts that you will use in SAS, just different syntax/names. &amp;#x200B; [SAS - STATA Code Comparison](https://www.cpc.unc.edu/research/tools/data_analysis/sas_to_stata/sas_to_stata.html)

Hello, are you expert in SAS and R programming. I need help with my assignment. Please let me know if you know SAS and R.
Is this literally your homework?
No
i do not where to start from. This is my first time using R. Can you explain me how to solve it Thanks
Try /r/rstats but also open up R and look up the help documentation for, say, read.table (type "?read.table" without quotes into the command line and press enter to get the help). Also, if this is literally your first time using R, go to the R help menu and open up the tutorial to learn basic syntax stuff.
Thanks! I started looking at the videos and they are actually so helpful and just what I need 
Because they don't care about the violent frustration SAS throws you into. I **hate**, **hate**, **hate** SAS more than anything right now. The class I'm taking makes me want to defenestrate my computer and shoot myself. As far as I am concerned, SAS is Satan incarnate.
In your post: &gt; Please help me with this assignment In the comments: &gt; Is this literally your homework? &gt; &gt;No &amp;#x200B; If you need help with your homework, just be upfront about it. That being said, I think you'd do well to try your best to truly learn the material, whatever it is. Maybe this is a language gap or just the way you wrote the post but it really comes across like you want someone to give you a demo of your homework. At the end of the day, this isn't super useful for the other readers of this sub, and what's worse is that it's really not useful *for you*. &amp;#x200B; Also, this is not the correct subreddit. This is a subreddit for sas programming, whereas /r/rstats is the actual sub you're looking for. &amp;#x200B; Finally, being able to read document and online resources to help you understand the foundations of a language/library/module/class/etc is really a crucial skill to develop. Try looking at the documentation. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Please do my homework is what you are asking. 
That's because they keep jacking up the licensing fees and have almost no overhead. I can assure you, as someone who is a decision maker at a major SAS customer, we are 100% trying to get people off SAS and onto R and Python, and for any new hires, those are two skills we are looking for. The reason SAS is still very popular and profitable is because of legacy code and systems. I could port code at my company from SAS to Python for the next decade and still have more to do. There are processes at my company that have been running for 20 years in SAS. There are a lot of older analysts who only know SAS. I can assure that SAS will be overtaken quickly by Open Source and is already happening. Just look at how quickly Linux overtook Unix and Windows. The several hundred SAS developers can't keep up with the millions of developers contributing to R and Python, and most SAS programmers are doing stuff in straight sql anyways. SAS has nothing as powerful as Shiny/R Markdown. Web Report Studio is a joke. SAS just added an ODS destination for XLSX files after they had been a standard in business for almost a decade, and it supports a tiny subset of the stuff I can do to an XLSX in python. SAS is still useful, but will be less and less useful as analytics organizations are starting to adopt more and more of DevOps mentality. The new data people are coming from CS programs and are familiar with R/Python/Spark/AWS/Google. It's going to turn into Fortran. People who know SAS will be useful for maintaining legacy programs, and that's it. New stuff is being done in R/Python and soon Julia. 
Sweet rant. :&gt;) &gt; I can assure you, as someone who is a decision maker at a major SAS customer, we are 100% trying to get people off SAS and onto R and Python, and for any new hires, those are two skills we are looking for. As someone who writes a lot of R and python code, those are skills I am always looking for too. I find all of those languages to be complementary and have been doing quite a bit of work with [SASPy](https://sassoftware.github.io/saspy/) and Jupyter notebooks. &gt; I can assure that SAS will be overtaken quickly by Open Source and is already happening. We could go on at length here, but the most honest thing to say is that *time will tell*. My own take is that I pick python for many projects because the tools often work well for every phase of the project: collecting the data from a variety of sources, organizing it, cleaning it, analyzing it, and presenting it. I have also worked on many projects for giant financial institutions where SAS is clearly the best tool because it runs on everything from PCs to mainframes, provides a vast number of procedures for doing almost everything, and is easy to learn while still being expressive. SAS is thriving because it still has competitive advantages in those environments. &gt; It's going to turn into Fortran. I love Fortran. As Tony Hoare famously said *I don't know what the language of the year 2000 will look like, but I know it will be called Fortran.* Comparing SAS to one of the oldest and most successful languages in history, which has evolved enormously over time while still being the workhorse language of science; well, that is high praise indeed. &gt; New stuff is being done in R/Python and soon Julia. I like two things about this: * "R/Python" It is fascinating to me how two such completely different languages (and philosophies) are taking joint custody of the new data science world, to the point that programmers really have to know both. * "soon Julia" I really hope this is the case. I keep reading about Julia's growth, but it never seems to make it into the final conversation when people are talking about new projects.
Absolutely. There are *huge* numbers of open datasets that you might find interesting. For example, check out [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?res_format=CSV) for files in CSV format. I personally love working with Sean Lahman's outstanding [baseball data](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/) when I am learning new packages.
Perfect! This is exactly what I'm after, thank you! Now I can get errors with new sets of data instead of the one I've been trying to work on haha.
Thank you!

I think we also need to see the first 15 lines or so of the data to really answer your question.
Did you ever solve this problem?
As others were saying, it would be helpful to see a few lines of the data. As it is right now I ran the following with the data formatted in columns in various ways and got the expected result: data test; infile "test.dat" truncover; input id 1-3 var1 5-6 var2 8-10 var3 12-15; run; As an example the data, I used the following with the first and last column aligned in various ways: 1 12 111 255 2 12 111 2 3 12 111 20 4 12 111 2 5 12 111 2 6 12 111 200 7 12 111 20 8 12 111 200 9 12 111 2 10 12 111 2 11 12 111 200 12 12 111 200 13 12 111 1 100 12 111 3 200 12 111 4 300 12 111 5 I did various column alignments to try and replicate what you are experiencing and couldn't get a similar result. Some questions that might help: 1) Just to ensure, the data are in columns correct? 2) How is missingness captured in this dateset?
Yeah that's the logo of Scandinavian Airlines...
Okay, I will try that
So you're saying the PROC PRINT step isn't producing any output? Are there any error messages in the log? As an aside, you should move your array statement and the do loop to be above the datalines statement. SAS actually executes the data step as soon as it encounters the datalines, so your other statements below are currently outside of the data step scope.
DATA file; INPUT name $ SmokeTobacco $ DrinkAlcohol $ TakeIllegalDrugs $ DrinkSoda $ DrivetoWork $; &amp;#x200B; ARRAY name (5) lowcase(SmokeTobacco)lowcase(DrinkAlcohol)lowcase(TakeIllegalDrugs)lowcase(DrinkSoda)lowcase(DrivetoWork); DO r = 1 to 5; IF name (r) = 'Yes' THEN name (r) = 'yes'; IF name (r) = 'No' THEN name (r) = 'no'; END; DATALINES; Tom yes no no yes yes Harry Yes yes Yes No Yes Jim No no No yes Yes Bob Yes No No Yes yes Andy No Yes No Yes no Cody yes No No no yes Ed Yes no No yes Yes Greg no Yes no no no Dave yes No Yes no Yes Steven Yes yes yes no Yes ; RUN; &amp;#x200B; PROC PRINT data = file; RUN; &amp;#x200B; this is what i did. but still get same original output as a data file.

SAS have done a pretty good job of purging the internet of their old logo which was similar to the airline logo. They changed it to the current one in the early 2000s .... but a few minutes of googling has failed to find an example. I'll have to search my old pay slips.
Please, no one waste your time reading or studying this. The questions are a mess, and many of the answers are totally wrong. Your time would be much better spent writing and running programs.
Glad you figured it out. I thought that might be the issue. 
Can you persist the macro variables in a shared table? 
Yes, but not sure if this would be advantageous if I still need a handful of external programs to declare the macros as well.
Haven't heard of this option before but I'll take a look into it this weekend
Use SASHELP library for data. Look at each dataset and think from standard user perspective to summarize the data. Create a table from on this standard
Things I have seen that can cause huges issues... \- Merging Normal Lab ranges unto lab data can get complex \- Visit Windowing \- Using some sort of Last Observation Carried Forward to populate missing values Now, sometimes each of those things can be easy, but other times I have seen the primary and qc programmer go round and round and round before they match. Depends on the exact specifications and the nature of the study data.
I've toyed with it, as my place of work are looking at migrating off the SAS client to SAS Studio. Good for code editing/completion. I've not yet worked out how to have a centralised autoexec, seems it's per-user, will have to read the documentation. Also, from the limited use I've had, it seems a bit slower in terms of responsiveness (i.e. laggy in the browser). The difficult part of migrating will likely be modifying code to run purely on the server, rather than the desktop.
So you are currently using the desktop windows SAS?
Having deep and thorough knowledge of SDTM and ADaM data standards is not easy to achieve. Dealing with poorly structured and poorly documented data is difficult. Especially when data is organised in one dataset per visit with one record per study and hundreds or thousands of variables, rather than organised by domain.
If you're used to the window environment (PC-SAS) then it's slightly worse but not as bad as Enterprise Guide in my opinion. It's fast, it's convenient, but not as fast and convenient as PC-SAS. I'm the product owner of a 30+ user SAS environment and while we're moving to Studio I want to keep PC-SAS on all our machines for fastest development.
That's my goal! Like I said I'm completely learning on my own in between my classes this semester, so I'm just trying to work out what I can right now. Thank you!
I absolutely agree with this. I recently started as a clinical data analyst. This is a challenge everyone face everyday regardless of the study. Even subject matter experts will have to take time to help answer questions or support. Poor data record keeping and mapping visits are what our nightmares are made of. 
I was a PC-SAS user and recently had to migrate to studio at my new company. It’s not too bad once you learn to deal with it. The biggest annoyance is speed. 
So you think it would be a pretty clear improvement over EG (which is what I am currently stuck with)?
/u/SeriousAdverseEvent username kills me given the nature of this topic. I just want to chime in that a lot of people do find those three things really impressive and helpful in programs revolving around QC'ing data. I actually have a section of patient profile programming that does a check against study normal ranges, checks a visit window for data in case of unscheduled labs and will carry forward (or backward) anything in the window to populate any visit within the window so the QC programs are as accurate as possible. I'd just add; lab conversions. Lab conversions are a pain in the ass with certain vendors. Then some labs can't be converted as they are and you have to take the components and redo the calculation....but that's more chemistry and math than programming, I guess... I'd deem all this easy if data is structured in an easy way though. I wrote a bit of a system that'll read in data based off spreadsheets where I can kind of spec out every variable I'll ever need and they'll always have the same variable name across numerous studies so all the programs work the same for all the checks and various programming. It's a solid day or two of work on study start up but that's how I get around pretty much every 'hard' thing, is the fact that I imported the data in such a way that I know exactly how to reach what and what needs to be done and then you can macro everything out by variable name in a stable fashion. Nothing is really 'hard' per se. It just requires proper planning. It's a silly question. Maybe it would be ok to ask to someone who's never held the job but if I was asked that I'd talk their ear off for as long as they'd let me about various complex situations and how I went about solving them....if you don't have the experience to do that then everything everyone has said here would be good answers.
&gt;I'd deem all this easy if data is structured in an easy way though. That is certainly true, but far too often the data is a mess (lab data especially with local labs).
To most techy programmers yes. 
Well, that would be good...I am chafing so bad with EG that I have actually developed fond memories of SAS on a VMS/VAX server.
&gt; if I was asked that I'd talk their ear off for as long as they'd let me about various complex situations and how I went about solving them Care to give examples? Are you referring to creating the SDTM data sets or just structuring the raw before sent off to CRO's as working? Love see your code sometime.. If its allright..
&gt;Merging Normal Lab ranges on to lab data Is it possible to give an examples? You already have spec sheet for normal ranges? how did/do you define normal changes? 
For a centralized autoexec, my work has just uses an %include statement to pull in an autoexec in an accessible directory. When users set up an account, they get an autoexec in their home directory that calls the central autoexec. This allows them to use the common autoexec but also add to theirs.
&gt; Is it possible to give an examples? You already have spec sheet for normal ranges? I worked on a large global study where there were more than 20 local labs were being used. \- Because of differences in equipment and procedures each lab provided it's own set of normal/reference ranges. \- Some labs would just provide a single range, where others would provide ranges broken out by gender. And in some cases we would get an overall range and then one for just one gender. (For example, there would be and overall range and then a female only range.) \- Likewise, in some cases there would be age specific ranges. \- Sometimes the ranges at a lab would change over time due to re-calibration and/or new equipment/procedures. So, then you would be merging on a different set of lab normals based on the date of the lab test. Inconsistency is the norm when you are working with multiple local labs.
If you want gobal autoexec settings you can put them in the workspace server autoexec. 
 data learn cheat; 
You should phrase your problem on here or on stack overflow. You're willing to pay for an assignment that you should be doing yourself, that seems blatant cheating and you will get in trouble Have you done any of it or are you just stuck on a particular piece of code?
Not in the clinical industry, but I was also going to suggest "dealing with someone else's data".
Can you provide an example of your data? I tried the following code (see below) and it came out as expected. Also, a tip for formatting: copy and paste your code/output into the reddit comment box, select the entire code/output and then hit the code button (looks like &lt;&gt;). It will preserve formatting from the copy paste like below. data have; input area id72; datalines; 1 20 1 99 1 15 1 21 1 32 2 18 2 32 2 1 2 99 2 5 3 55 3 99 3 99 3 20 3 3 ; run; data lead; set have; if id72=99 then id72=.; run; proc means data=lead mean stderr; var id72; class area; run; 
In list input SAS essentially just reads the data in the order they appear on each line. It works fine if the data is in a format where you can assume blanks are just empty space in between variables rather than part of a data value. Column input reads data from specified column ranges, which means data values can have blanks and you can skip reading in some of the variables just by not specifying them. Obviously the data needs to be prearranged in columns. Formatted input uses a specified informat for each variable both to determine the length of the field as well as apply any necessary data transformation or cleaning in the process. It's useful for reading data in nonstandard forms, particularly if you are prepared to create your own informats with PROC FORMAT. I actually think the SAS documenation on the [INPUT statement](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=pgmsascdc&amp;cdcVersion=9.4_3.4&amp;docsetId=lestmtsref&amp;docsetTarget=n0oaql83drile0n141pdacojq97s.htm&amp;locale=en) is pretty good at explaining this stuff.
Thanks so much!
How are you invoking the parallel processes? I'm unsure from your description how this is being achieved. Some thoughts: * if you're invoking in batch mode, there is a macro variable that you can define using an input option which allows you to pass macro vairables to a "child" program, assuming you're using shell escape to achieve what you're doing or similar. * if you're concerned about capturing the %INCLUDE file in your EG project, you can just open it in your EG project, and then reference it in the code. So, have it as both an external file, and a project object. That way you get to call it using %INCLUDE, and it's also in the project if you're exporting the project object (.egp) to some sort of external version control (git). If there's an issue with it also executing in the "parent" project, then you can setup some logical test using the branching capability in EG, and have it never branch (e.g. branch when 1=0) to the object that's in the project. It's a hacky way of doing it, but effective. * look at the EG options around autoexecs - there are some auto run capabilities in the client that will run whenever EG starts. I believe there's also an option for "run this before any step" or similar.
&gt; It's going to turn into Fortran. The more apt comparison, the one that more closely matches the poster's intent, is COBOL.
It means the dataset called run in the work library does not exist.
I'm just horribly confused. I never saved a data set as "run". :( 
What code are you running that produces that error? Context would help. Assuming you’re trying to refer to a dataset called run that’s stored in your work library, the error message is telling you that it doesn’t exist. Are you sure your “run” dataset is in your work library? Are you sure it’s called “run”? When you created the dataset, did the data step execute successfully?
Somewhere in the code, you refer to a dataset called run. In a proc print/freq/means/whatever, or in a set statement. 
So, do you mean I must have called something run? I'll see if that's the case. I'm not at home where I can post a photo as of the moment. I'll try to do that when I get home. But I'm almost certain this is not the issue. I even showed my code to a teaching assistant. Sigh.
My first though also. Almost anytime "run" appears where you don't expect it is because of a missing semi-colon.
Somewhere, your code is making SAS think that you want it to go looking in the work library for a dataset called run. Check all your semicolons, especially the ones right before run statements. 
I'll try that. Thank you.
If it's an exercise for school you should just post the code. It's probably small. Copy paste it in. It sounds like you used a proc and forgot a semi colon so the proc thinks the implicit data= is named "run" if they're not teaching you to explicitly call data= and instead having it carry the last used dataset (bad practice imo).

(I realized my asterisks between the slashes will make my text italicized on Reddit.)
well, one thing wrong is that your format name &gt;format fibertert fibertert.; should be, assuming using the proc format from the previous step &gt;format fibertert fibertertF.; but if fibertert is not a variable in NGHSDATA2 then I'm not sure if that'll fix that. double check that's a variable that exists in there? you should really be explicit too &gt;proc rank data=nghslib.NGHSDATA2 groups=3 out=nghsdata2; but that's my opinion and shouldn't effect the outcome here. it's just good practice imo.
I still get the same fricken warnings, but now I see a result table.
Biggest issue I can see is that 'fibertert.' should instead be '$fibertertF.' Give this code a try and see if it works or produces a more helpful log. options mprint mlogic symbolgen spool; *just helpful options to write a more verbose log file; *this is question 2 and 3 - PROC FORMAT STATEMENT HAS TO ALWAYS BE BEFORE THE DATA SET STATEMENT; proc format; value fibertertF 1='low' 2='medium' 3='high' ; run; data nghslib.NGHSDATA2; set nghslib.NGHSDATA2; run; proc rank data=nghslib.NGHSDATA2 groups=3 out=work.nghsdata2; var fiber917; ranks fibertert; format fibertert $fibertertF.; *the period indicates what you're connecting things to - This statement is connecting fibertertF from proc format to fibertert from ranks; label fibertert='Fiber Tertiles'; *tells SAS to find this variable and give it that name; run;
Do you have a typo when creating that variable? I run into this error message when I have misspelled a variable name.
This won't work either; you're defining a numeric format but trying to use the character format of the same name.
My out didn't have nghslib before NGHSDATA2. That solved it. Thank you!
What are you trying to achieve? We need more context to help you out. Maybe post a screen grab of your dataset.
Thanks for the response and tip on formatting.The dataset is large, it's lead exposure among children with 20+ variables. But I did figure out what happened. It is ld72 with a lowercase L, not uppercase i. So a little embarrassing!
SAS communicaties forum post: https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Programming/Multivariate-analysis-Do-I-use-Proc-Corr-or-Proc-GLM-or-Proc-Reg/m-p/505707#M135461
"Multivariate" would imply that you were testing multiple outcomes. Which would look like several simultaneous regression equations: A = X + e B = X + e C = X + e ... Where X is the predictor and A, B, C... are the outcomes, so you would be testing whether the disease causes risk factors (?!). "Multivariable" would be testing one outcome with multiple predictors: X = A + B + C... + e Which suggests the opposite. That the risk factors cause the disease. I'm not an epidemiologist, but this is usually what people are interested in, right? Now, there are methods to do correlations with 1/0 binary variables, but there's a bit of complexity there that I think you should avoid. Mainly, this is a fishing trip and the results wouldn't be very rigorous. You also mention an ANOVA. Implying that there's a continuous outcome variable and several categorical predictors. Disease is a binary variable, so if this was the outcome, this wouldn't be appropriate either. So, what to do? Start with your outcome variable. I think it's disease. It's binary. What methods can we use for a binary outcome? Well, we could do separate tests for each variable on the outcome according to whether it was a binary or continuous variable, but you wouldn't be controlling for the variance from all of the separate risk factors ("multivariable") in these and you'd run into the problem of running multiple tests (Fishing trip: The chances of finding a significant result increase with each test because of just dumb luck, not because it's a valid result). There are of course adjustments for this too, but what you probably want to do is a "multivariable logistic regression". Here we are with this equation again: X = A + B + C... + e We're estimating each individual risk factor (regardless of it being binary/continuous) at the same time, which means we're controlling for each risk factor and their dependence on each other. We're only performing one test so that we don't have those fishing trip p-value issues that arise when interpreting multiple tests and we'll have results that give us an estimate of the effects, the odds ratio/risk ratio for each item and whether or not it's statistically significant. The end product would be something like: "When A, B, and C are each present, the odds of X are increased/decreased by whatever percent". You can do this with PROC LOGISTIC, specifically, or PROC GENMOD and PROC GLIMMIX more generally. Good luck! 
If you’re outcome is binary, either has disease or does not the you probably want logistic regression controlling for your prediction variables. I’m not a statistician Syntax for prod logistic https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63347/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_logistic_sect059.htm
Should be proc logistic data=mydata; 
The only thing I might add for OP's sake is "(event = 1)" just to explicitly specify which part of the outcome the odds are referring to: model disease_status (event = 1) = riskfactor1 riskfactor2 riskfactor3 ;
I think /u/ox2bad has you covered. SAS will recognize the levels for anything specified in your class statement whether they're numbers or characters. 
The class statement print making too much sense to me. I did: Class riskfactor1 riskfactor1...riskfactor2...3...4...5...6...7* riskfactor3 riskfactor4...5..6...7 [aka my binary categorical predictors] ; Model disease_status (event=1)= risk factors 1-7; Run; Now I'm getting a syntax error that I'm missing and it's expecting one if the following : Name, ; , (, - , /, :, _all_ , _character_ , _char_ , _numeric__. The symbol will be ignored. I'm assuming it's the / But what do I USE after it? 
It's a syntax error which I can't diagnose without seeing the actual syntax. To be super clear, the syntax should look like: proc logistic data=mydata; class riskfactor3 riskfactor4 riskfactor5 riskfactor6; model disease_status(event=1) = riskfactor1 riskfactor2 riskfactor3 riskfactor4 riskfactor5 riskfactor6; run; To be excruciating, replace the words `mydata`,`disease_status`, `riskfactor1`, `riskfactor2`, `riskfactor3`, `riskfactor4`, `riskfactor5`, and `riskfactor6` with the names of your dataset and the appropriate columns in it.
I'm a statistician, you want logistic regression.
Perhaps my most legit validation ever. 
I haven't done this myself, but I see that a Stack Overflow post recommends creating a CSV in Python and importing that to SAS. Personally, I'd recommend using a delimiter besides comma (like pipe or tab), as commas are much more likely to appear within data fields.
Or quote your text fields when creating the csv - SAS can deal with that when you import it.
It worked! (I think). 2 more questions. 1. Why do we only state the categorical variables in the class statement and not the two continuous one's? 2. How do I decide which P values to use from the results if the question is "is there correlation between the variables and developing the disease or not?" Ie: Test: - chi square likelihood -chi square Score - Chi Sq wald? Type 3 Analysis of effects: -gives me DF, Wald Chi Square Pr &gt; Chi Sq Analysis of maximum likelihood estimates: Gives me DF, Estimate , Wald Chi Square, PR&gt; chi square Odds ratio estimate: Point estimate 95% Wald Confidence Limits Association of predicted probabilities and observed responses -Somer's D Gamma Tau-a C I was thinking Analysis of maximum likelihood, but I'm just not sure.
Thank you! I put that in :)
Question for anyone who may know /u/moochiemonkey , /u/statistics2015 , /u/ox2bad 1. Why do we take out the 2 continuous variables from the "class statement" ? 2. I'm a bit wary of my results here. None of my variables are significant, but I'm also not positive in reading this correctly A)) My maximum likelihood estimates give me all negative estimates for all my variables. &lt;-- this just means that my odds ratios are all &lt; 1 right? B)) do I use the Wald Chi square value or the odds ratio point estimate as my reported value on is there association/strength of association. I'm thinking odds?? Thanks for all your patience as I learn! 
1) because the `class` statement tells SAS which of the variables are classification variables (or a categorical variables -- same thing). We know which ones are categorical variables, we're just telling SAS. We don't put in the two continuous variables because they're not classification variables. 2) Logistic regression is not very powerful (you need a large sample size or huge effects to see significant results). If your sample size isn't very large or your effects aren't really big, that could explain the issue. A) If they're not significant then their sign doesn't matter. The odds ratio compares the two groups relatively -- if you reverse the groups your maximum likelihood estimates will reverse sign and your odds ratio will be above 1. This won't change the Pr&gt;ChiSq (so won't change significance). You *could* recode the variables and the sign will change, and the odds ratio will invert. Again, as they're not significant you probably don't have to do this. B) The Wald Chi-Square value is the actual value of the chi-square test statistic, and doesn't have any real meaning other than its translation into the p-value. If you're looking for a number that's interpretable in any way, you probably want the odds ratio (and its 95% confidence interval-- showing it includes 1 and there's no significant difference). If you have access to a statistician who can look at your data at all, I would recommend you talk with them about these things.
Start by looking at jobs where there will be a business need for you to study the course. 
No
It means you're trying to do something numeric with a character variable or, less commonly, the other way around. Here's a solution where your dataset is called abc and the variable of interest is X1: Proc contents data= abc; run; There you'll see that your variable X1 is defined as character So, Data abc2; Set abc; Length X1b 8.; *This creates a new numeric variable called X1b 8 of length 8, allways make numeric vars 8; X1b = X1 * 1; * This sets X1b = X1 but is numeric; Run; Now re do your proc reg or whatever with X1b ideas of x1
Sorry for formatting, did this on my phone
I'm not going to say you can't do it, because SAS's versatility is continually surprising, but I suspect there is an easier way to accomplish what you want to do. RTF just isn't a format designed to be easily read in this way. You might have better luck if your report was created for a different destination, such as ODS EXCEL, but in general the easiest way to capture data from a report is to use an output dataset. Some PROCs have an output statement or other syntax for creating output datasets, but there's also the ODS OUTPUT statement which can capture any ODS object in a dataset, see [this example](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=pgmsascdc&amp;cdcVersion=9.4_3.4&amp;docsetId=statug&amp;docsetTarget=statug_ods_examples04.htm&amp;locale=en). 
If it’s a character you can use the index or find function I believe to return the place in the string. Something like Data wanted_rows; Set table; If index(var,’6’) and index(var,’7’) and index(var.’10) then output; Run; 
Awesome, I shall give that a go, had no idea you could seperate it like that.
Is it in a WEIGHT statement?
That's the Cody book. Which edition? Simple odds ratio is a **proc freq** with a **relrisk** option.
/u/calach_ is pretty close, but not quite watertight. using index(var,'6') will pick up 6, but also 60, 16, 26, -6, etc. You might have to account for the commas (to not catch those other numbers), and then include edge cases for 6 being the first or last element. Something like... &amp;#x200B; `if (index(var,',6,') or strip(scan(var,1,','))="6" or strip(scan(var,countw(var,',')))="6");` So index(var,',6,') picks up a 6 in the middle of the list, strip(scan(var,1,...) picks up a 6 at the beginning, and the last part picks up a 6 at the end. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Just use indexw() to search for complete words.
Are the values contained within a string, as per your example, or are you referring to data in which a column within a row contains a single value, and you want to find the columns which contain 3 specific values across all the rows of data?
If the data is as you show (a list of numbers within a string) : `data testdata ;` `length value $32. ;` `value = '1,6,12,4,8' ; output ;` `value = '7,4,3,8,14,44,6,100,10' ; output ;` `run ;` &amp;#x200B; `data want ;` `set testdata ;` `find = '6,7,10' ;` `found = 0 ;` `length n $3. ;` `do f = 1 to countw(find,',') ;` `n = scan(find,f,',');` `if indexw(value,strip(n)) then found + 1 ;` `end ;` `drop f n ;` `run ;` &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; |value|find|found| |:-|:-|:-| |1,6,12,4,8|6,7,10|1| |7,4,3,8,14,44,6,100,10|6,7,10|3| &amp;#x200B;
4th edition. How exactly would that code go? proc freq; relrisk (exposure*outcome); run;
Yes.
Hmmm. Okay.
The example in my text: Data odds; Input outcome $ exposure $count; datalines; case 1-yes 50 case 2-no 100 control 1-yes 20 control 2-no 130 ; proc freq data=odds; title 'There's a title'; tables exposure*outcome / chisq cmh; weight count; run; 
I solved things after talking to my TA. But thanks for your help. SAS kills me.
No experience with RAVE/INFORM, but REDCap exports directly to csv, and creates SAS scripts to import data. While some systems offer an API that you can connect SAS directly, most are export data - import into SAS.
https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63033/HTML/default/viewer.htm#mixed_toc.htm SAS has a really good support website. Above is the link for proc mixed. I havent ever used proc mix with a model statment as the one you have above so im not sure how to explain it. Hopefully you can find and explanation online somewhere.
Another way to create SAS datsets using SAS ODBC from all ODBC compliant data sources.
Data yourdata2; Set yourdata; Diff = Var1-Var2; Run; Substitute your variables and dataset names. After this step, run your ttest.
Do all the SAS datasets have similar names? If so, you can wildcard them on the set statement using a colon : suffix. For example, if all the datasets begin "zip5" &amp;#x200B; data all ; set optum.zip5: ; run ;
They are all in the same folder but I do not think it is a directory of files 😬
Absolutely nowhere. University edition is closest thing, I guess. Sas is expensive and really, really good at locking their toys up.
I guessed to, isn’t there any price for student version without using it in virtual machine?
Thanks for this answer.
In this case, I'm not sure a SAS macro is needed. The SAS macro is a powerful tool, one which you can take advantage of once you get a bit more familiar with SAS. But for this specific example, I would suggest foregoing the macro altogether. Simply concatenate the data sets in a data step, then use proc export to send the data to an Excel file. One of the lessons you won't learn in class about SAS that you'll learn once you start using it professionally is that there is a tension between efficient code and efficient brain time. The thing I drill into programmers on my team over and over is that if there's a simpler way to write the code, even if there's a more efficient or slicker "programmer" style solution, always default to the option which takes less time to solve. It's very easy to get stuck down a rabbit's hole of writing a macro to do something where you can accomplish the same thing in a couple of data steps or procedures. Sometimes simpler is better.
When I try to run the SAS program various ways (e.g., batch submit with SAS 9.3, %INCLUDE statement, batch file, SAS Enterprise Guide), it appears to be working properly (pulling data through Oracle, geocoding it, creating data files) until it needs to invoke SaTScan. However, when the SAS program is manually opened and submitted in SAS 9.3, the program fully executes with no errors. I’m not sure how to determine if the issue is stemming from SAS, SaTScan, or Windows 10 (possibly something to do with privileges).

Also, since macro programming is essentially "Writing a program to write code", it often leads to code that is much harder to read down the track, which can be a problem if you ever want to re-use to code or if you have to hand it over to someone else.
The [SAS Programming 1: Essentials](https://support.sas.com/edu/schedules.html?ctry=us&amp;crs=PROG1#s1=1) course is available as a free e-learning course and includes datasets and programming exercises. Unfortunately some of the content on the exam is covered in the SAS Programming 2 course which is not free. For what it's worth an 82% would be a passing score on the certification exam. It's a good idea to try to aim for a higher score, but from SAS Institute's perspective there's no difference between someone who just barely passes and someone who gets 100%. They won't even let you retake the exam to improve your score.
thank you
I think the substring function works in sql
In your datastep: &amp;#x200B; ColA = substr(ColA, 1, 3);
Or: &amp;#x200B; format ColA $3.;
This is correct.
Format would retain the longer length so it's not worth it as it would just "mask" it. Substr(column,1,3) is the best solution could even apply a strip() function or compress() to the column if the data could have spaces for them to be removed. One other way would be a length statement on the column 
Can you do windows 10 enterprise or pro as your jump box?
Substring and Id also use upcase to manage data quality and consistency because I have mild OCD. 
Try going in Sasensei as well. They have multiple choice questions some may be more challenging than others and out of the exam's scope nevertheless it would give you more practice. I was in the same situation, do not worry the exam is purposefully made difficult and tries to catch you out with some questions. Unfortunately the best option would be to have sas open and practice scenarios (what if i have a sum statement vs sum function and a missing value, what length gets set for substr function outcome etc etc). If you don't have access maybe you could download the university edition? Otherwise look at sas documentation online which has examples of code. Best of luck!
Same props to you 
As long as the dates are a date variable and not a character variable the format doesn’t matter because SAS uses something called a SAS date, which is the number of days since January 1. 1960. I would start by double checking the dates are a not character or numeric and that the member ids in both tables are the same length. If they are try stripping the member ids (removing the leading and trailing spaces). This can be done using strip(member_id). Also double check that there are end dates in the left table that fall between the start and end date on the table you are joining. It could be that the join is working but there is no data that should be pulled into the join. 
I'm out of ideas then. The join works fine without the date parts.
Are you absolutely certain that one is note a DateTime variable instead of a Date? Two minutes with PROC CONTENTS will probably add greater clarity to this. 
Why do you have to change the format in proc sql? 
One is a date the other is datetime so change the datetime one to a date using datepart(x) as NewDate. Now join on date=NewDate. 
Looks like one of them may be a date the other datetime. You can tell by looking at the data and seeing vastly different numbers (datetime would be much much larger). 
I'm assuming this is all happening in SAS, and not in a database like Oracle or Teradata or something. This might be a pedantic nomenclature thing (I kind of doubt it, but maybe?), but when you say the FORMAT of a field is YYYY-MM-DD, that doesn't necessarily tell us anything about the actual data. In SAS, dates are a numeric field where the value is the number of days since January 1st, 1960. You can apply whatever date format you want to the data, but the actual value doesn't change. Formats simply change how that data is displayed when human eyes look at it. As others have pointed out, my suggestion is to convert the date time field to a date using the datetime() function. Think about what your logic is doing. The episode end date is a relatively small number, somewhere around 30,000 or so (I can't check SAS, but it's somewhere in that neighborhood). The start and end dates you are comparing to are gigantic by comparison - the datetime field is a count of the seconds since midnight of 1/1/1960. So that number is going to be in the millions. Your logic is essentially comparing a small numeric number to a few really really big numbers - of course the small number won't be between the two really big ones. If you want to see what's happening, take an example row or two from both tables, strip out all formatting for the date fields, and then look at the logic you're using to join. It should be pretty clear why this isn't working as intended. Also, I just want to mention that SAS sometimes has trouble parsing AND clauses. I've seen it happen where SAS interpreted two AND clauses as an OR - meaning the join I was doing didn't work properly. I assume you have a validation step after this to verify that the dates are lining up correctly in the result of the join. If not, I highly suggest building that into your process.
Are you obligated to do it in one step? If not, read it in, name the unitpurchased variables with a suffix ending with a number (makes writing the array statement easier/more transparent), use a do loop on the array on those with a retain on the ID, make two new variables for the final id/unitpurchased and only keep those, use explicit output statements to output the retained ID and each of the columns in the unit purchased array. It sounds like a lot but it's just a read and one data step. There's probably some way to do it directly on importing the .dat but I never bothered learning all the commands during imports...rather just import it and deal with it.
Something like this? data Purchase (keep=id unitpurchased); infile ‘c:\temp\PurchaseRecords.dat’ dlm=’,’; input id $8 visit_no @; do i = 1 to vist_no; output; input unitpurchased @; end; run;
 data testscores2; set testscores; perfect = max(of score:)=100; run;
nice alternative. Suppose I'm actually searching character strings, though? In my real program, I'm using **=:'{stuff}'**
Max works for char strings too. In case you are searching for a specific string you could concatenate all the variables and use the Index function to search if what you are searching for exists in any column. 
Array and do-loop would be my first choice as well, since you can easily modify it to incorporate new scores or use macro vars for even more automation. 
I'm not sure I understand your question. You want to only extract year eith 2 values then why not use a where condition instead of if so you will only read in those years. What helps me when I struggle is to prepare a sample data and what expected outcome would look like. This way you can start thinking about what steps you need to make to achieve the expected data. Do you want to keep all the data? Only a subset? Do you want to calculate columns for all data or just subset?

I want to know if there is a way to specify the two years within proc univariate/class statement instead of using a where condition after the data step.
Don't believe you can do that although I haven't used univariate in a long while. Is there any reason you cannot have a separate data step and a work table just specifying the desired years. Could you achieve what you're aiming for with proc means? Hope someone else jumps in to help or if you figure it out do comment here with the solution. Good luck! 
No specific reason, I would just like to keep the code as concise as it possibly can. Sounds like I will just have to use another data step. Thank you for the help though.
I’m not gonna do your homework for you, but consider using a retain statement. 
I’m not gonna do your homework for you, but consider using a retain statement. 
Yes, retain and lag. Since you're supposed to do it in all one data step, you'll have to use lag to figure out when you change to a new salesperson. This would be much simpler with a sort and first-dot and last-dot logic. That would also require retain for the salesperson name.
\^\^\^\^ THIS proc univariate ... ; where ... ; .... ; run ;
Give this example a read and a try. https://chemicalstatistician.wordpress.com/2018/04/23/sort-a-data-set-by-ascending-or-descending-variables-using-proc-sort-in-sas/
Also it sounds like your dataset is not reading in correctly. Howany observations do you expect in it? Have you tried a proc import?
Same thing happening here, no observations copying over to the out = dataset &amp;#x200B; libname sportbar 'H:\\673Project'; run; proc sort data=sports\_bar\_earnings out = sports\_bar\_earnings; by Taxpayer\_Name; proc print data= sports\_bar\_earnings; run;
Thank you.
If it hasn't been solved yet, Could you share more information? Which sas product are you using? What is the source code and what does the file look like (obviously dont share sensitive data here). Is it csv? Tab or comma delimited? Are you defining the infile statement(s) and input correctly - correct order and correct type? Maybe you're accidentally pointing to a different file by having a typo in the name?
I wish we could. I am told that we only have licensing for virtual servers.
Without knowing what the data set you have looks like or what the error message you are getting says, it's hard to say what's wrong with your code. If you are working with a data set where there is a field called Initials, your code looks like it should work. I'm assuming you have a data step that looks something like: &amp;#x200B; data want; set have; newvar = substr(initials,3,2)||substr(initials,1,1); run; &amp;#x200B; There's nothing wrong with that syntax, even if it is a bit outdated. Don't worry, I use that pipes as a concatenation function still as well. If you respond with your full query and a bit more information about what you're trying to do and what the error message is, we can help diagnose the issue much more thoroughly than we can with what you've told us already.
I would suggest using the scan function using the comma as a separator, instead of substr. newvar = scan(initials, 2, ",") || scan(initials, 1, ",");
proc format; title 'In-Class Exercise Nov. 5'; value highBMIf 0='a.low BMI' 1='b.moderate low BMI' 2='c.medium BMI' 3='d.moderate high BMI' 4='e.high BMI'; value SBP1f 0='a.low SBP' 1='b.yes moderate high SBP' 2='c.medium SBP' 3='d.moderate high SBP' 4='e.high SBP'; run; &amp;#x200B; data nghslib.nghsdata2; set nghslib.nghsdata2; run; &amp;#x200B; proc rank data=nghslib.nghsdata2 groups=5 out=BMIdata; var highBMI; var SBP1; ranks highBMIqnt; ranks SBP1qnt; format highBMIqnt highBMIqntf.; format SBP1qnt SBP1f.; label SBP1qnt='SBP Quintile'; label highBMIqnt='BMI Quintile'; run; &amp;#x200B; proc freq; tables highBMIqnt\*SBP1qnt; run; &amp;#x200B; I did a data step using my data set, too. Still getting nothing but error :(
No real idea, since I don't know what your data looks like and thus can't reproduce anything. But in your proc format you define *highBMIf*, but in your proc rank you call format *highBMIqntf*.
I actually did catch that and fixed it. Still didn't help. I'm at a total loss. This code is also verbatim what I had to do in a previous assignment with the exception that the variables have changed. I don't know why nothing is working.
I had to look at output data and take the 'high' off BMI1. Problem solved. Thanks anyway.
Here's what you do: reverse the data setup, reformat highBMIqnt highBMIqntf.;, add the new label and... *Shove it up your butt!*
I needed this laugh. Thank you so much. Omfg. 🤣
If I have understood correctly you will need to create two datasets from this one, one with those that have had the dosage altered and one where they haven’t. Within both datasets you could dedupe them based on the subject ID and then you can do some match merges to determine who is only in the dataset without dosage altered. E.g Data altered not_altered; Set Inputdataset; If dosage=‘altered’ then output altered; Else output not_altered: Run; Proc sort data = altered nodupkey; by subject; run; Proc sort data = not_altered nodupkey; by subject; run; Data in_altered_only in_both In_not_altered_only; Merge altered (in=a) Not_altered (in=b); By subject; If a=1 and b=0 then output in_altered_only; Else if a=1 and b=1 then output in_both; Else output in_not_altered_only; Run; The dataset in_not_altered_only will give you all the subjects that haven’t had any dosages altered. 
Thank you so much that worked! Was driving me mad haha 
No worries. Been using SAS for ten years and regularly do this sort of thing. Glad it worked for you. 
Cool! I’ve not long started a new job so SAS is quite new to me. I’m understanding it but there’s some things that catch me out and I’m left without a clue haha. Any tips or books that you think could help? 
I would just retain a flag for ever being altered. You could modify something like this to do whatever you need to do with the final dataset(s). You have to sort by ID first. Data deduped; Set original; By ID; Retain altered_flag; If first.ID then altered_flag=.; If description = “dose altered” then altered_flag=1; If last.ID; Run;
Great thank you! 
Learn SAS? Yes. Learn SAS from a rip-off outfit in Bangalore? No. Just stop spamming.
 proc summary data=mydata nway; class category; var balance; output out=outdataset sum=bal_tot; run; proc print data=outdataset; run; 
Thanks. I found something similar on google but i think i missed the "output". I will try it tomorrow. Again thanks.
You most likely shouldn't after you note that every post here has an average of 3 comments and that SAS has been losing market share like crazy to R and Python. 
Not a SAS wizard, but it might mean that one of your groups you’re doing an analysis on has 0 subjects in it, and the software can’t determine if there’s a difference between groups if there’s nothing (0) to compare it to. 
Ahhh! Yes, I think you're right. I forgot about that.
Wait, SAS is a programming language?!
It’s also the most used tool!
SAS has a GUI?! Damn.
I've never seen this error. The "where" statement is in a datastep? Perhaps try a proc sql, or replacing the where with an if. I know sometimes string storage can cause some funny errors in SAS as well. Try scrubbing for odd characters like '0a'x and '0d'x and such, look those up because I'm going off my head and just trying to give you the idea of what to look for.
Setting the memsize to 0 was a good move - I've seen problems like this caused by memsize being set unrealistically low. Therefore the problem must be with that INPUT function on the WHERE statement. Suggest you start by following drunkferret's suggestion (change where to if). If that doesn't work then test MEMSIZE to find out the actual available RAM. Submit this code: proc options option=(memsize);run; (You might find you had less RAM available than you thought.) Can you post the INPUT function? I'm curious about what informat could be causing this. Try rerunning the step with the system option FULLSTIMER enabled. It'll show how much RAM is actually being used.
Has it been a long time since you closed or refreshed the system. Sometimes we take up all our memory with lots of temporary (work) datasets. Use the SAS explorer to close those you no longer need
I've come across this a few times when I had to run SAS through a citrix virtual server. Basically, the program just used all the available RAM for the virtual server. I made the office buy a license for my local workstation (which has 16gb of RAM) and it's never been a problem since. Plus, now it runs wicked fast too. I use SAS to automate data analysis and export reports - it used to take 30 seconds per database to analyze and export the report. Sometimes I need reports for a few hundred data sets - so it could take 30-60+ min pretty easily. Now it only takes about 5-6 seconds per dataset. 
Is this not an I/o issue 
This isn't exactly an informed post. Open source languages like Python and R are growing in popularity, largely due to the rise of big tech giants and their help building libraries. For example, Google hired one of the main contributors to TensorFlow. SAS is still used heavily in large banks and insurance companies, and I can tell you first hand that its a set of software that fills a niche better than Python does. When the regulator asks for data lineage for your IFRS9 model, do you want to trawl through 5000 lines of code on github or do you want a tool, like SAS Lineage, to do it for you? All I'm saying is that SAS has had competition before (e.g. from SQL) and it's survived and thrived so far... I doubt it's going anywhere any time soon. 
So you're argument is that analysts, developers, and statisticians should learn a clunky and expensive tool because there's a niche application that solves a problem that keeps middle management and C-suite types up at night, and that this tool is the only solution for that because you've set up a nice little straw man that assumes the other path is to let developers write code willy-nilly without requirements or documentation? That's not really so much an argument as it is a sales pitch. My response, still, is the deafening silence in this subreddit. That tells you all you really need to know.
Your xx can be: intnx('month',"&amp;sysdate"d,1)
Yep, this.
so its; Where VARIABLE="intnx('month',"&amp;sysdate"d,1)"; ? Thanks for the help. Im still a bit new to sas and coding in general :-). 
Yes, basically what the statement says is take today's date (sysdate) and advance it 1 month forward. You can also use this function to go backwards in time, just change the 1 to -1 and it will go back one month from the current month.
Okay great. Thanks. I was not sure it would work in the middle of my where statement. 
I see no reason this shouldn't, in principle, work in University edition, it just seems the default filepath isn't one you can write too. Try replacing all references to the quoted string `'seeds'` with `'/folders/myfolders/seeds'` and see if that works. In general, debugging macros in SAS is made easier by turning on the [MPRINT](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=pgmsascdc&amp;cdcVersion=9.4_3.4&amp;docsetId=mcrolref&amp;docsetTarget=p1dhqw0i5yj2m8n15opapnwteqra.htm&amp;locale=en), and possible [SYMBOLGEN](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=pgmsascdc&amp;cdcVersion=9.4_3.4&amp;docsetId=mcrolref&amp;docsetTarget=n0lh4tuknkdkf2n1d4qi7utpyf5n.htm&amp;locale=en) and [MLOGIC](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=pgmsascdc&amp;cdcVersion=9.4_3.4&amp;docsetId=mcrolref&amp;docsetTarget=n0xmqcv92coq2tn1k0z0q6fl2dew.htm&amp;locale=en) options. Good luck!
have you tried running SAS in admin mode?
If you mean the "Syntax error, expecting one of the following: INTO, POINT, VAR, VARIABLES" error, it sounds to me like an error with one of the IML READ statements. Unfortunately, looking at the code I don't see any obvious problems with them. I would suggest running the program with OPTIONS MPRINT turned on and the posting the section of the log for the code which is generating the error. Otherwise it's hard to tell what's going on.
I think i formulated something wrong before. My code is: where VARIABLE1 between 01 and 31 and VARIABLE2 &lt;&gt; 11 and VARIABLE3 in (49,59,69,79,89,99) and substr(put(kundenr,z10.),3,2)='XX'; I have tried to use "intnx('month',"&amp;sysdate"d,1)" but i cant get it to Work. Can you help me?
Is variable 1 your date field? If so you want to say between "01oct2018"d and "31oct2018"d
I don't think the problem is with the macro, I suspect the problem is with the data you are trying to put through the macro. Without knowing the specifics or seeing the entirety of the log, it's hard to know for sure. There are comments in the code for the macro you linked that say the data file you put into the macro need to be in a certain order and in a text file - maybe double check that those things are happening?
I wasn't able to figure the problem out, but I was able to use the full version now. There it worked without any problems. Thank you all so much for your help!
&gt; "31oct2018 my variable1 is named kundenr as in the substr part. Its DDMMYYYYZZZZ and ='XX'; is a month number like ="10"; I need this to be Current month +1 
I dont think i can do it that way or im not sure where to put the code you wrote. Let me show my code as it is: where kundenr between 0101000000 and 3112999999 and spkode &lt;&gt; 11 and alder in (49,59,69,79,89,99) and substr(put(kundenr,z10.),3,2)='10'; Its the "='10';" I need to change to Currentmonth+1
There is a try it for free links on their website https://www.sas.com/en_ca/software/intelligence-analytics-visual-investigator.html
I just downloaded it. Will try it :-)
Thank you!
Thank you but this is view only environment where you can see existing alerts and analyze them ,you can't create any.
Looks good. Downloaded out, will try during the day. Is there details on what is covered in the full version? That would be good to see.
Apple?
I'm game to try it. Im very new to programming and not a lot online for SAS
Unfortunately, at the moment it's only available to android, but if there's a demand (after all the kinks have been sorted out), I will look at options to extend it to Apple users as well. Thanks 😊
Great, thanks for that!
Please feel free to leave some improvements in the chat, like additional questions to ask, ideas for exercises, exam questions, bug fixes, etc.
I have it a go. It's pretty slick. Very nicely done. Covers the topics that any new SAS programmer is going to need to know. Great job.
Thank you very much, hopefully, we can take it further!
I would love to see you expand it to basic stats stuff like which test for which data. And then get into plotting and graphics, too. Also: proc freq, proc corr, proc reg, proc logistic, proc univariate, proc anova.
Why use macro lists for this? Create temporary tables instead and then you can do joins and merges with them, which is a much more natural approach and will scale better.
That's a long post about a homework assignment. What's the question? I read the last little bit and that seems really straight forward. Use a datastep to check the genders of each of the tables you merged, I'm assuming there's some kind of ID for the biopsies or whatever (there would be in real life), sort and merge them by that...then you'll have the two gender vars...make a new gender var with some simple if statements. If it's more complicated than that then feel free to clarify what your question is specifically. 
I’m going to send this to Oracle. Wouldn’t lists be better/necessary for that?
Does it show up in the notes? You could use options nonotes; 
that didnt seem to do it.. i think a problem could be above the code here is some lines that say &amp;#x200B; DEFINE member\_firstname/ style(header)=\[just=left\]; DEFINE member\_lastname/ style(header)=\[just=left\]; DEFINE member\_/ style(header)=\[just=right\]; BY memberid member\_firstname member\_lastname member\_homephone member\_pcp\_bizname NOTSORTED; &amp;#x200B; Not my code/ i am trying to help my GF and i dont even speak computer language lol. Thank you for the help. even if its a mystery we appreciate your time.
You have to at least pretend like you’re not asking a homework question :)
lol
I mean, seriously - you didn’t even bother to remove excess new lines. It’s like you literally copied this from a PDF or something. 
In general, you need three times the space for your data sets, but you also need space for all the applications to be installed including Windows. You'll likely also want to install Office, to export data to Excel and test it and such. &amp;#x200B; I did not actually partition my internal drive, I purchased an SSD or flash drive and run it off that instead. It stays plugged in and is super small, 128GB is about $20 these days. I did mine a while ago (several years) and use a 512GB SSD.
I imagine SAS tech support would be preferred over depending on a subreddit. 
Instead of looping you should create a macro that pushes the list for your filter into Oracle so you don't also run into the limit on the macro variables. Here's the SAS supplied workaround **Create a string that goes beyond the 64K limit for macro variables** [http://support.sas.com/kb/39/605.html](http://support.sas.com/kb/39/605.html)
TLDR: Click the tag button Is this subreddit run by the SAS marketing team? 
Lol
I'm not on the SAS marketing team. I'm in R&amp;D, and I write a lot of SAS blogs on data visualization.
Mostly, I would say to do your own homework. Since it's been a few days, maybe the deadline is passed and you just need some help/advice with solutions. That said, here are a couple of high level suggestions. 1. Creating a library should be pretty straightforward. If you don't know how to do this, I am worried you will be unable to complete the rest of the tasks. 2. Creating the temporary data set (hint: data sets created in the WORK library are temporary) should be straightforward. Simply apply exclusion logic (using IF or WHERE statements) to properly subset the data. Similarly, use an IF statement to create the diagnew variable. 3. This is kind of pedantic on my part, but I am struggling to see why your instructor would have you create an "other" category in Step 2 and then have you exclude the others in step 3. But whatever. This should be easy. If diagnew is other, then delete. 4. Importing should be easy - SAS comes with a wizard to import data. 5. Just remember that merging data sets requires that the data is sorted first. Otherwise you'll end up with mismatches. 6. What I believe to be the only possible issue or complexity here is that gender appears to be coded in both data sets. If the column is named the exact same thing in both tables, the merge is going to use one to overwrite the other. You'll need to code around this by either renaming one of the columns in the pre-merge data (which is what I would suggest), or use fancy in= coding in the merge step. This is not hard, but it is hard**er**. Once you have the merged data, you can use IF/THEN logic to check for gender mismatches between the two gender columns in the merged data.
You can’t run as admin in SAS University Edition. 
Almost anything you want to learn can be found on lexjansen.com. I would co sider that the equivalent to all the free training for R, or blog posts. Professional Rstudio or Tidyverse, Plotly courses run about the same price. 
Even funnier ... they took the posting down HaHaHa

This is more of a curiosity thing than meaningful feedback (sorry): does this get you into legal trouble if SAS catches wind of it? I'm not sure what falls under their copyright/trademark/legally protected IP. I'm just curious if there is a possibility that by creating this app you're putting yourself at risk for legal trouble.
Good question and I have the answer for it. I haven't released my own SAS Software, this is just a guide for the language. Sas is a programming language and you can't own a language, they can trademark the software, etc.. The matter of fact they tried to build a case around this with smaller companies and lost in the court. I think "World programming" got into some trouble for re-engineering SAS software and releasing a SAS solution of their own, but that's a different story. 
What do you need to do?
It's really open ended. I was given 4 different data sets to choose from: I went with number of voters in about 3,000 counties, broken down by party and given for the last 3 presidential elections. I just have to come up with questions for the data and then use SAS to solve the questions. I can pm you the sheets if you wanted to see them?
Sounds pretty simple. You just need to do some summary statistics on the dataset by the sounds of it. Look up proc means and proc freq
So far, I've run a simple proc means for the entire thing. With help of another classmate, I also did a proc sql to make a table of the difference of each year (just by subtracting them) and then I graphed those with proc sgplot. I suppose I'm also just having trouble coming up with something more to do. I really want to impress my professor because he's a vp at a bank and I feel like if I do great on this it could help potentially land me an internship (he said he might have some of his employees come to watch our presentations as well)
Some questions you could answer with proc means, proc summary, or proc SQL: * What is the total number of votes for each party in each county? * Did these patterns change at all between elections? * Which counties had the largest swing in vote totals for each party from one election to another? You should be able to answer these questions fairly easily in proc summary/means. Don't forget about your "by" and "var" statements in the proc. This is how you will generate party/county level statistics. Good luck! 
Excellent username. :)
Thank you! I'll be playing around with it all day today and tomorrow solving as much as I can! :)
Dude no offence meant by this but this sounds so so simple. Forgot about what you know about SAS for now and just think about what stats you can do on this dataset. Like, what profiling can you do on this dataset, age*vote, gender*vote, post code etc. What cross tabs and averages can you show for the demographics. Decide what you want to show then figure out how to do it with SAS code using proc means or proc summary. If you can do that you will pass this with flying colours. Iv got tens years experience using SAS in a leading Bank and this is pretty much my day job 
I'm sure it is simple... But try to look at it from a prospective of someone who has zero experience in any coding and only had a 5 week class for sas, of which the professor mainly wanted to teach us how to figure it out on our own... This is a tiny part of the data set and the code I've written so far. I feel like it's not enough and I need much more of something: https://imgur.com/a/CiPNlVw
Message me the assignment.
Newvar = catx(' ','Hello', variable1) I think that should work.
Hmm, Im a bit confused.. But i think you want something like this. &amp;#x200B; proc sort data=have nodupkey out=x0; by id date opioid; proc summary data=x0 nway; class id; output out=x1(drop=\_:) sum(opioid)= opioid\_usage; proc sort data=x1; by id; proc sort data=have; by id; data final; merge have x1; by id; run;
Thanks for the input. It is a little confusing, and my mock example data probably wasn't as clear as it could have been. I actually have already removed duplicate values. I'm trying to add up where opioid = 1 for each unique date and participant based on their (ID). &amp;#x200B; I feel like I should be using some conditional type coding or an array, but I'm unsure of the syntax to get it to look through the columns correctly. 
thanks. can you add more text behind variable1? 
Yes. Please look up the SAS documentation on concatenation. This is quite simple with a little googling. &amp;#x200B;
Have you tried running my code? It should give you the exact output that want in your mock. Try it and get back to me. &amp;#x200B;
Something like this? Proc sort data = &lt;libname&gt;.&lt;filename&gt;; By date opioid; Run; Data....; Step....; Format opioid_count 8. Final_opioid_count 8. First_opioid_count 8. prev_opioid_count 8.; By date; /*****not sure if this is the right place for the by statement, so might have to play around with it**I forget sometimes****/ Retain opioid_count first_opioid_count final_opioid_count prev_opioid_count; If first.date then do; First_opioid_count = 1; Opioid count = 1; Prev_opioid_count = 0; End; Else do; Prev_opioid_count =opioid_count; Opioid_count = first_opioid_count + prev_opioid_count; End; If last.date then output; Run; There is probably a way to do it with a proc SQL step as well but I'll have to look it up and I'm using my phone atm 
Sorry the formatting is not as I typed it. 
*Edit use the by date opioid in the data step or it'll throw an error
i will do that :-) thanks. it was hard to google when you dont know the word.
My thought would be using a RETAIN statement w/SUM FUNCTION or use the SUM STATEMENT (x+y) to accumulate the new VAR. In both of these cases, you would need a BY statement, and in this case it would be BY ID. &amp;#x200B; DATA Want; SET Have; I would start with RETAIN OPIOID\_USAGE ; OPOID\_USAGE = SUM(OPIOID) ; BY ID DATE ; Run; &amp;#x200B; I am not a SAS expert. But this is where I would start to play around if I were you. &amp;#x200B;
Was able to test it! Looks to have worked like a charm, going to double check it but really appreciate the guidance. 
Copypasta your code here (there's a code block format that can make it easier to read), and we can help you troubeshoot.

I posted it. I've been discussing with my teacher but I just don't know what to look up to find why I am having the issue since each varible is in the proc contents and will run on proc means. 
Note that none of your PROC MEANS have a DATA= statement. I suggest adding it in so that it’s clear which data set is being used. 
The ones I’m testing have it. I have some of my analysis coding I need to do once I can use the variables I created.
We can only comment on what you post and show. So if you’re not posting the code you’re running I cannot know that or comment on it. 
with proc sql you could do something like proc sql; create table new as select id, count(unique(date)) from &lt;dataset name&gt; where opioid=1 group by id; quit; this will give you one observation per ID though. if you need all the observations you could always merge this with the original dataset
Find the SAS function documentation. In there, there’s a page that has functions by category. It’s super easy to use and learning this will make you a much faster programmer. That should be your best friend for your homework. Bookmark it. I’m not telling you where it is so you know how to find it again. 
I got it figured out.
Here you go. Instead of the upcase on the character variables, just set them to ' '. https://blogs.sas.com/content/sastraining/2017/06/27/how-to-perform-an-operation-on-all-numeric-or-all-character-variables-in-a-sas-data-set/
Thanx, yes that's it. That is a neat way to do it.
data want; set sashelp.class; if \_n\_ = 5 then call missing(of \_all\_); run; &amp;#x200B; proc print data=want; run; &amp;#x200B;
You don't even need to define arrays to do this: /*Generate a writable dummy dataset*/ data class; set sashelp.class; run; data class; modify class; /*Write to dataset in place, i.e. without replacing the whole thing*/ call missing(of _all_); /*Set everything to missing*/ output; /*Append a row*/ stop; /*Halt after 1 iteration*/ run;
data abstract_merged2; set abstract_merged; array r_date {634} re_date1-re_date634; Array col {634} col1-col634; do r = 1 to 634; if r_date[r] &gt; 0 then col[r] = re_date[r]; end; run; data x0; set abstract_merged2; Var_want = min(of col:); Drop col:; run; Try that.
Alternatively, u could set all the re_date variable that are less than or equal to zero to null and then take the minimum of those variables, which would save u a step.
Thanks for the reply. I figured it out, but I'll try your method as well always good to have more tools in the toolbox. 
You're welcome.
Add a leave or break that will end the loop as soon as you find the value. Or change your loop from a DO to a WHILE or UNTIL. 
something interesting to know about that could help: call sortn http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrdict/64316/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a003106054.htm 
What is ur code?
Yes, but your data is already in the correct structure for SAS and most software. Search lexjansen.com for papers on any topic you want. SAS has been around for 40+ years so there’s a ton of material out there. 
What info are you looking for?
I do - maybe I can help 
Same. Ask your question. 
Hey, I edited my original post to add a solution. The trick, was to add a "Leave" to end the loop once it found the first value. 
Thanks for the info. 
Maybe I can help!
Thanks for the help :-). 
Does health insurance count?
Add another loop though the versions of the different names. %do word_cnt 1 to 10 ; %if word_cnt = 1 %then %let word = door; The rest of your existing loop here %end; Your macro names would be bb_&amp;word._&amp;i
Is there a reason you wouldn't just use an array?
You need a period after your incrementer on mobile please forgive me **%macro abc;** **%do i=1 %to 11;** **if bb\_door&amp;i.=1 then bb\_door&amp;i.\_score=1;** **else if bb\_door&amp;i. in (2 3) then bb\_door&amp;i.\_score=0;** **%end;%mend;%abc; run;**
Agreed.
You should use an array here, not a macro. A macro is overkill. You could also just use a format depending on what you're doing. &amp;#x200B; proc format; value bb_fmt 1 = 1 2,3 = 0; ; proc freq data=have; table bb_: ; format bb_: bb_fmt.; run; &amp;#x200B; or arrays: &amp;#x200B; data want; set have; array bb(*) bb_:; do i=1 to dim(bb); if bb(i) in (2,3) then bb(i) = 0; end; run; &amp;#x200B;
I 3rd this. Array this
Actually for the IF in you need to set options minoperator; Atleast I do when doing open code if then else.
It wouldn’t be needed here because that’s data step code. As long as using a modern version (9.1+) it should be fine. MINOPERATOR is for when using IN within a macro ie %if &amp;x in (1, 3, 5). Or maybe it’s %in? Getting late :)
I'd say stick to the SAS courses if you want to test for Base SAS certification. The course content is most likely to reflect the actual Base SAS test content.
Thanks. 
The Base SAS certification guide is the best reference I've read either in terms of preparing for the exam, or writing SAS data steps. Take or leave the training course, buy buy the certification guide and read it 
Thanks. I was checking out the reviews on amazon, etc. I've heard it's got a lot of errors / incorrect code in examples. Is that so? Any idea?
I have the older edition (still SAS 9), but that has not been my experience. I used it extensively while preparing for the exam and ran most of the code in it. I did notice a couple of quiz questions that didn't work, but it was a small number (2-3 in the whole book, and it was pretty clear by reading them that they were off)
That I can deal with. Thanks. 
Base SAS: Buy the cert guide and study it - forget any other training..waste of time. Advanced SAS: Take working code, have a co-work randomly delete a few characters and add a ; here and there, and predict what will happen when you run it...that covers about look and feel 75% of the exam, the rest is can you count the number of &amp; correctly. 
I just took the base cert exam back in July of this year. The prep guide is a wonderful resource. There are a few typos so do be aware of that and you need to know that the practice questions in the book are complete garbage. The actual test questions will be much more rigorous in general. 
Other suggestion, there’s a detailed list of topics. Find the list, find the best resource for that topic in the documentation that and Lexjansen.com I think they finally removed that section on reading text files, yay! Most data comes in via dB or API now, that was outdated for sure. At the same time also the hardest part of any tool. 
This post has 90% of what you need. Once you’ve got it nailed you can learn about multidimensional and temporary arrays. https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/sas/seminars/sas-arrays/
Perfect. Exactly what I was looking for. Thank you.
As someone who hires SAS programmers, this is exactly what's wrong with SAS Certification in general. If you haven't had some experience actually programming in SAS, you're going to be totally worthless as an employee. If I want someone entry level, I'll train them myself. Don't worry though -- I can spot you in the interview, but going through that process is just a waste of time for both of us. To make your "certification" mean something, go through training guides and practice writing programs. If you really want a job in SAS, this is the least you can do.
I totally agree. A cert by itself is utterly meaningless, and so is the SAS provided training. You have to just have time behind the wheel with SAS..there is no other substitute
Can't offer you any advice but you have a job I think I might be well suited for. Can I ask your qualifications?
When I entered, I had a BA/BS in a science field and experience with R, SAS, and research. Those were my only qualifications. I'd look for Associate Statistical Programmer or Statistical Programmer positions, if I were you. If you want to impress your interviewers, read up on CDISC standards. 
I’ve seen people post here looking for guidance on how to complete different tasks. You can try that here. Also feel free to pm me. I can’t promise I’ll be able to solve your problems, but I’ll try my best. 
I'll help out
Can you post more details?
Hi vaulcanbluesteel, thanks so much for offering to help! There are five different assignments. Here's a question from one I'm working on now. 
You could probably find a remote position doing clinical trials. I say go for it. The people over at /r/FinancialIndependence can help 
Ok so what code do you already have?
I hire people with your skills and I'm my opinion, you're in demand. If you can afford to take a break from work to experience life I say do it. Also, talk to your boss. They may let you work remotely when you get back or make some other arrangements. A good employee is hard to replace and it can take more than three months to find a replacement. 
I actually already solved this one! As I’m working through the questions I get stuck sometimes not knowing how to do something. I usually try to figure it out myself first, but if I can’t is it ok if I pm you? 
I'm also a SAS Programmer in the CRO industry. I don't know why you're going into an office at all. Take your vacation and get a remote job when you get back at it. Clinical trials aren't going anywhere (as far as I know).
Yes no problems
Hey send me your code anyway. I might be able to help improve it
My other half works in risk functions using SAS and her 6 months traveling hasn't resulted in any issues. As far as I can see it's seen as normal part of a CV these days. I wouldn't think twice mate, there's plenty of remote roles going if you're worried about having a gap but I honestly wouldn't stress about as it looks like you have plenty of experience.
Thanks and good luck!
Demand is high enough that I don't think that it would hurt you too much. It might come across as a bit of a red flag, but we are so desperate in the industry that it would be a very small red flag. I agree with the people saying to look for a remote job. It may have to be contract work at first, but you could probably tread water doing that until you found something you liked better. &amp;#x200B; If you like your current job okay, it might be worth asking if you could take an unpaid leave of absence. It may not be normal practice, but simply having you away for awhile would be a lot easier and cheaper than having to hire someone new.
Out of curiosity, are you in the UK? I’m thinking of taking a year out to do a masters and I’m in a similar boat to OP - SAS background. 
Not sure how to do it with this interface, but [proc delete](https://go.documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=proc&amp;docsetVersion=9.4&amp;docsetTarget=n1469bsvzgd33jn0z4xecxmx2bgo.htm&amp;locale=en) is the easy way to delete datasets programmatically.
Or proc sql; drop table work.blah; quit;
proc datasets lib=work nolist kill; run; quit;
Go the Libraries pane. Click on work. Right click and delete each data set you no long want. 
Thank you for your input. I am holding my options close to my chest - but if I do leave, I will leave on very good terms with my company. I think it would be best for me to move to a new company, as I am not challenged in my current company. Also - it occurs to me that we may be edging closer and closer to a recession. Do you know how the pharmaceutical industry is affected by recessions?
How long have you been at it? Were you doing this line of work during the last recession? If so, how was hiring affected? I know that companies shed positions like CRAs easily, but am not sure how stat programmers are affected. I know what you mean about remote work. I guess I enjoy going into the office a couple of days a week - my coworkers are fun, and it is more fun interacting with them in person.
Thank you for your input :)
Thanks for your input. I am sure that they would furlough me for the three months, if I asked. However, I am not content in my current position - I am not being challenged, and a change of pace does not seem likely. So, staying with them is not a great option. Because I have little desire to spend much more time at my current company, I think it would be improper to ask for a furlough and then leave shortly after returning. I couldn't do that to my manager, my director, or my coworkers. I know you're not suggesting that, I guess I'm just thinking aloud. 
13 years I've been in CROs...since I was 18. I've been pretty much everything you can be without a master's degree. I plan to go into consulting in another ~5 or so hopefully. I've been a SAS programmer in some capacity for ~8 of those years. I've been 100% dedicated as *the* SAS programmer for a little over 6 now. It's always been high demand, I was kind of pushed into it because I was doing some other adhoc programming....they bought me a book and paid me to go get certified for it because the sponsors want everything done in SAS for whatever reason. Job security is rarely ever on my mind, I can always just hop to another department or company....super high demand for people with my experience...I have a really dense working history at CROs though. I can't imagine it would be hard to get a job whenever though if you've got experience in the industry as a SAS programmer already though. Medicine isn't just going to stop being tested. CRAs have always been a revolving door for the whole time I've worked in CROs, it's no different now than it was during the recession...that's a shit job, it'll continue to be a shit job. It's painful to deal with sites and everyone's just mad at you all the time for not training the sites better and not verifying source docs faster...it's just a really bad job. I do know some places treat their programming deptartments like a puppy mill though and do have that CRA-esque revolving door because of it. Keep that in mind when job hunting. What you really want is to be a dedicated resource to a team handling a certain indication instead of working in the programming department, but that's probably easier said than done if all you have on the resume is programming.
The Database is not shown in the Libraries Pane or in the working Tables. Its only in the Task &amp; Utilities Section.
Nothing worked. I only kicked them out of the blue circle, not the red one :-( &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Yeah I work through in the UK, I'm one the growing few in the analytical space that doesn't have a degree so I'm probably not a good person give you advice on going back to school.
New certification fixes this. I took the Beta exam this month for it. You have to actually write code to solve questions. I figured having the new certification would look better since it's mostly performance based. SAS Certified Specialist: Base Programing will replace the old exam early next year. The advanced will follow suit sometime mid next year.
Want a real challenge. Take the new certified specialist base Programing exam when it comes out. Performance based exam where you have to actually do the code to get the answer.
Thanks. I'll look for it on the SAS website. I think it's still in the Beta test phase though. 
I took the SAS courses, one at the very nice HQ campus in Cary. My problem was that nobody I interviewed with was willing to train.
If you took the training courses at SAS Institute, you would likely not need as much training from your prospective employer as someone with no training at all. I'm not against training -- just taking certification exams by memorizing questions and answers.
That's very encouraging. Thank you for the update!
Beta ended December 7th, but the site changed so it may be open again. I should know by mid January the results. Its 2x as long as the old one and you had 50 to 60 questions. You can now take exams online....wish I had that luxury lol. https://www.sas.com/en_us/certification/credentials/foundation-tools/base-programming-specialist.html 
Sorry, you’re writing your data sets to libraries, the portion before the period. You have to go to the specifies library and delete them, so not work. 
I solved it. I deleted *WE.tablePrefs.key* in the /SASUniversityEdition/myfolders/.sasstudio/preferences/ . Now it starts with a clean working Environment. Thank you all for your help!
I found a solution. I deleted the WE.tablePrefs.key in the .sasstudio/preferences Folder. 
I totally agree that you should not take a leave of absence and then after that quit the company. That would leave some hard feelings. The CRO world is not a super big industry, and someone interviewing you in the future could easily know someone at your current company. There are a lot of phone calls in the industry that go something like this: "Hey, did you work with Jane Smith at CRO X? You guys were there at the same time. What did you think of her?"
data new(drop=keep); set old; by PersonID; retain keep 0; if first.PersonID then keep=0; if Value &gt;= 10 then keep=1; if keep then output; run; 
In the infile statement add the options... *DLM='09'x DSD*
Yes, that's a good thing to try. The file may have tab delimiters. If that doesn't work, try reading it in a fixed position. For example: input @1 field1 8. ...
I'm not sure if that works, but it's asking for trouble (and confusion) naming a variable as the SAS keyword "keep."
I concur. I was a bit confused even attempting to read that. 
I'm sure my code works.. sorry about the confusion with the naming convention.. But it is still syntactically accepted..
In most cases, I wouldn't read a delimited file using column pointers.
Would this work? Proc import data = 'file\path\goes\here.txt' dbms = dlm out = one; Run; This is how i import csv files in notepad (i just switch "dlm" for "csv") 
We don't know whether it's a delimited file or fixed length, given the information we have.
data want; set have; by personid eventdate; if first.personid then flag=0; if value&gt;=10 then flag+1; if flag&gt;=1 then output; run; or data step1; set have; date2=eventdate; drop date; where firstval=1; run; data step2; merge have step1; by personid; if date2&gt;=eventdate then output; run; 
Do you need doctor or just minimum time? MinTine = Min(of doc1, doc2, doc3) 
Just the time. Wow, that was a lot briefer and more concise than I thought it would be. Will try it now!
What's the code please?
In the data step, you must create the new variable. (Pardon, I'm on mobile now) &gt;data want; set have; &gt; DrExam=min(Doctor1, Doctor2, Doctor3); &gt;run;
Also works if all variables are character and have leading zeros!
Thanks!
Thank you!
It would work but generate a warning in the log. That’s not a good idea because you then cannot tell a real issue from one where you were too lazy to convert the types. 
So you want to report each student on a separate page? There are a lot of different ways to do this, but I suspect PROC LAYOUT is not necessary.
That's what I was thinking. But yes, every student gets their own page. Does that mean separate data outputs for each one?
So student name would need to be a variable and tagged per whatever grade on each observation, but use macros. Make a dataset out of the names, proc sort noduprecs by that variable. This is your source of names. Then use macros and a null datastep to set some macro variables...you should %let in the datastep 3 variables, an open(), an attrn(ds,NOBS) and a close(). That'll lay out a way to loop your origin dataset so in the macro you can %do ctr = 1 %to &amp;macrovarSetByLength (the attrn NOBS)...then you can per each loop of the macro, data x (your current student), obsnm = &amp;ctr; set sourceds (your student name list) point=obsnm; output; stop; run;....then you can null step, symput that student name to a variable, end the step, call a if/where on that name to get your dataset out of the origin dataset only containing x student...do whatever you need to do. Personally from that point I tend to call another macro to perform another set of ops on the data, but you could just output what you need in your scenario without the need for additional macros. I work with patient data. We have hundreds, frequently thousands of patients that need reports by their 'number', specific to them, laid out all pretty....so same kind of thing would work here. 
ODS PDF puts pagebreaks between output from different procedures by default, so a PROC wrapped in a macro loop should handle that part just fine. The question is just what proc produces the report you want elegantly. Just because I'm in the mood for it, here's a data step example: data students; input Name $ 1-13 Grade $ 15-16 ClassRank 18 QtrYr $ 20-26; cards; Parker, Peter A 1 Q3 2018 Munro, Ororo B+ 2 Q3 2018 ; ods pdf file='filepath.pdf'; data _null_; set students; declare odsout o(); o.table_start(); o.row_start(); o.format_cell(data: name,style:'header'); o.format_cell(data: QtrYr,style:'header'); o.row_end(); o.row_start(); o.format_cell(data: 'Grade = '||grade); o.format_Cell(data: 'Rank = '||put(ClassRank, 8.)); o.row_end(); o.page(); o.table_end(); run; ods pdf close; You'd probably have to change this to get it to work on your actual data, but it may give you an idea.
ODS PDF has a ‘newfile’ option that will create a new file for each by group so a proc print and BY statement. Unfortunately it creates files with names such as Student1 and Student2. I would control my layout with a style rather than use the RWI personally, especially for such a simple task. If you PM me.

Sweet thanks

Here's one way you can do this easily. First figure out what the report looks like for one person. Then replace the code with your code. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; `*macro to print a single row;` `%macro printName(name=);` `options nodate nonumber;` `ods pdf file="/folders/myfolders/&amp;Name..pdf" style=journal2;` `title "Demo Report for &amp;name";` `proc print data=sashelp.class noobs label;` `where name="&amp;name";` `label age='Age (years)' weight = 'Weight (lbs)' height = 'Height (inches)' name = 'Name'` `sex = 'Sex';` `run;` `title;` `ods pdf close;` &amp;#x200B; `%mend printName;` &amp;#x200B; `*run for all rows in your data set;` `data _null_;` `set sashelp.class;` `str = catt('%printName(name=', name, ');');` `call execute(str);` `run;` &amp;#x200B;
Back in the office now (what was I thinking posting this on Friday at like 4:30? All it did was make me worry over it all weekend), and your method generated the best-looking output. Thanks!
Glad I could help. Happy new year!

Correct me if I’m wrong here, but by selecting into a macro variable, it’s storing the dates as character variables. This would mean that 31DEC2018 is greater than 01JAN2019 because 3 &gt; 1 in character land. 
Aaaaaaaaaah shoot that makes so much sense. I’ll just keep it as the number and it’ll totally work. Thanks!
I updated my response above with an additional note. Please take a look before updating your code. :D
 Yes, I saw that change! That is what I do in the other codes like this; not really sure why I switched it to the date nine format for this particular task.
I would use an array. 
First, I would consider whether there might be an argument for storing the data in a different arrangement, i.e. transposing the table so that it's stored with columns (for example) Date, Brand, Price. Then you can just do "newPrice = Price \* 1.03". However, let's assume that you don't want to do that (or can't, for whatever reason). Then the main approach would be to use an array. data new; set old; array Prices {*} &lt;list of every variable here&gt;; do i = 1 to dim(Prices); Prices[i] = Prices[i] * 1.03; end; run; Of course, that then means that you need to produce a list of every variable that you want to multiply. You could keep that in a macro variable, or you could use _NUMERIC_ or _ALL_ if the dataset contains only those variables you want to reference. Or you could use a variable list, e.g. Honda -- Lexus, but that works *only* if the set of variables you want to adjust *always* starts with Honda and ends with Lexus in the order they appear in the dataset (and variables are notorious for not being placed consistently in a dataset depending on how you operate on them).
I see it done in ex. 32.27 on this page https://newonlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat482/node/46/ so I guess yes you can. Can anyone comment on why you would or wouldn't want to use a join or do it implicitly like this? Now I'm curious...
As someone who knows sas only, I would code it up similar to the second example. Never seen the (+) notation used. 
I believe you may be wanting to create what SAS calls an ["Inner Join"](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/sqlproc/63043/HTML/default/viewer.htm#p0o4a5ac71mcchn1kc1zhxdnm139.htm) where you discard observations from Table_A and Table_B that do not match across tables. 
I believe older versions of SQL didn't have the explicit join ("INNER JOIN X on yada yada") syntax yet, so you used to just list all of the tables in the FROM clause (comma delimited) and the join conditions were part of the WHERE clause like the above. &amp;#x200B; It makes the code much more difficult to read than using explicit joins, but a lot of people who learned it that way will still do it that way just because they're used to.
It's legacy SQL code (which still works, just looks really ugly) that predates being able to use explicit joins, I think.
It's actually a left join, hence the (+) in the WHERE clause. I strongly prefer to use explicit joins, but what I was given is such a tangled mess I'm just trying to get something to work in as little time as possible. Whoever wrote the original code didn't bother to indent, and has queries nested within queries, within queries within queries... it's awful lol.
This. 
If you don’t specify a join type, it ends up defaulting to a cross join in SAS. The *Where* clause will filter the results but I believe it’s less efficient to do it this way. 
Hm, this is interesting. I had a similar issue, but solved it by renaming my variables Var1-Var100 in order to do an array because I needed the same prefix. Can I do an array with the column names not being similar?
Yep! Another comment in this thread covers that pretty well (and I’m on my phone so I won’t repeat it). 
I’ve come across this before, Oracle actually treats it as a Left Outer Join, for SAS I don’t believe this exists since this is Oracle specific, a Left Join will probably be what to use. 
Thanks!
No problem! Incidentally, I should note that Reddit formatted a couple of things I didn't want it to. The special variable lists are: _NUMERIC_ - all numeric variables in the dataset _CHARACTER_ - all character variables in the dataset _ALL_ - *all* variables in the dataset You can also do weird stuff like Honda-numeric-Lexus, but if your data is structured such that that's the best approach that then I would take it as a sign that you've done something really bad in a past life. (There's more info on the SAS help page for [variable lists](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrcon/62955/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a000695105.htm).)
If you want people to help you it would be prudent for you to describe exactly the type of logic you are looking for as opposed to having us guess. It looks like you want an output data set with one record per year, and potentially the highest Hospital_ty_IV for that year? If so, something simple will do: proc sort data=have; by year descending hospital_ty_iv; run; data want; set have; by year; if (first.year); run;
My apologies. I'm trying to capture ty\_IV =0 only if it's a unique hospital number and year, if there are duplicate values I'm trying to retain only those values that have a ty\_IV = 1. Thanks for the suggestion, but I don't think that did the trick. &amp;#x200B; I've updated the post. 
Sort it by year and ty and take the last. Sort it by year and descending ty and take the first. Proc sort data = have; By year descending ty; Run; Proc sort data=have out=want NODUPKEY; By year; Run; Or Proc sort data=have; By year ty; Run; Data want; Set have; By year Ty; If last.year; Run; 
It should work. If it doesn’t please post some sample records where it didn’t work. 
Without data to test your code, this is hard to help you with. Can you provide sample data in a data step?
I personally recommed STAT 480 to learn effeciently about the base programme. just google it. source helped me lot to understand about sas. hope you will be benifit from STAT 480
Have you taken the training courses covered on the exam (SAS Programming 1 and SAS Programming 2)? The SAS Programming 1 course is offered as a free e-learning, and goes over a lot of the Excel info. [https://support.sas.com/edu/schedules.html?ctry=us&amp;crs=PROG1](https://support.sas.com/edu/schedules.html?ctry=us&amp;crs=PROG1) 
It was on me for poorly explaining, it worked but I didn't provide enough information. The example data I provided was just a short sample that didn't adequately capture what was going on. There are more hospital numbers to account for. &amp;#x200B;
My apologies. I didn't provide enough information. I'm just not super familiar with methods for subsetting data but I think the last.variable is probably what I need. I'll do some reading on that. Thank you. 
Added in some sample data. Thanks! 
The last.variable was the key. Got it to work with: data want; set have; by year hospital\_number; if (last.year) OR (last.Hospital\_number); run; 
Sorry about the formatting. The ...... are spaces. I thought 4 spaces made code indent. I'm losing y edge. 
Instead of using "today()" as the 'seed' date : %LET SEED = %SYSFUNC(today()) ; Then replace every instance of today() with &amp;SEED. That way you can generate the macro variables for any given date.
Oh that is very smart. Thank you for the tip. 
Change it to SELECT name INTO :pname separated by '' &amp;#x200B; This will trim the trailing spaces. &amp;#x200B;
This is an ideal scenario in which to use a hash table. In this example, the hash table happens to be the same table which you're processing. It's not quite clear from your explanation which way this lookup works though, is it looking down the data from the current record, or up the data (i.e. is there a record with the same ACCT/NRT that has the current record DATEKEY value in the NextActDate field?). I think it's the latter based on your image - you're flagging the current record based on specific criteria. &amp;#x200B; `data want ;` `set have ;` `if _n_ = 1 then do ;` `declare hash lookup(dataset:'have');` `lookup.definekey('NRTNUM','ACCT','NextActDate');` `lookup.definedata(); /* no fields need returning from the hash table in this example */` `lookup.definedone();` `end ;` `/* use the current record values as keys to the hash table */` `rc = lookup.find(key:NRTNUM,key:ACCT,key:DATEKEY) ;` `if rc = 0 then Workable = 1 ;` `run ;` &amp;#x200B;
Nested do loop for the purposes of compounding interest is very inefficient (although I understand why it's posed as a programming challenge). Far better to use algebra. rate = 0.0365 ; period = 365 ; periods = 365 \* 6 ; interest\_rate = ((1 + (rate / period)) \*\* periods) - 1 ; interest = amount \* interest\_rate ; &amp;#x200B; Therefore the interest on $3500 over 6 years = 3500 \* (((1 + (0.0365 / 365)) \*\* (365 \* 6)) - 1) = 856.86176 &amp;#x200B;
You sure about that? I suspect it's just last.hospital\_number you need, not last.year. 
This sounds very useful. Is this something you would be willing to share?
Fabulous. Thank you for your contribution.
Use the `trimmed` option or `call symputx` instead to create the macro variable. &amp;#x200B; Try running the following and see what happens in the log. You should also consider the `noprint` option on your `proc sql` statement. That will prevent SAS from creating any output in the listing or html output. proc sql NOPRINT; select name into :report_name from sashelp.class where name ='Jane'; quit; %put #### &amp;report_name ####; proc sql NOPRINT; select name into :report_name TRIMMED from sashelp.class where name ='Jane'; quit; %put #### &amp;report_name ####; data _null_; set sashelp.class (where=(name='Jane')); call symputx('report_name_data', name); call symput('report_name_space', name); run; %put #### &amp;report_name_data ####; %put #### &amp;report_name_space ####; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; output: &amp;#x200B; &gt;1 OPTIONS NONOTES NOSTIMER NOSOURCE NOSYNTAXCHECK; &gt; &gt;68 &gt; &gt;69 proc sql NOPRINT; &gt; &gt;70 select name into :report\_name &gt; &gt;71 from sashelp.class &gt; &gt;72 where name ='Jane'; &gt; &gt;73 quit; &gt; &gt;NOTE: PROCEDURE SQL used (Total process time): &gt; &gt;real time 0.00 seconds &gt; &gt;cpu time 0.00 seconds &gt; &gt;74 &gt; &gt;75 %put #### &amp;report\_name ####; &gt; &gt;\#### Jane #### &gt; &gt;76 &gt; &gt;77 proc sql NOPRINT; &gt; &gt;78 select name into :report\_name TRIMMED &gt; &gt;79 from sashelp.class &gt; &gt;80 where name ='Jane'; &gt; &gt;81 quit; &gt; &gt;NOTE: PROCEDURE SQL used (Total process time): &gt; &gt;real time 0.00 seconds &gt; &gt;cpu time 0.00 seconds &gt; &gt;82 &gt; &gt;83 %put #### &amp;report\_name ####; &gt; &gt;\#### Jane #### &gt; &gt;84 &gt; &gt;85 data \_null\_; &gt; &gt;86 set sashelp.class (where=(name='Jane')); &gt; &gt;87 call symputx('report\_name\_data', name); &gt; &gt;88 call symput('report\_name\_space', name); &gt; &gt;89 run; &gt; &gt;NOTE: There were 1 observations read from the data set SASHELP.CLASS. &gt; &gt;WHERE name='Jane'; &gt; &gt;NOTE: DATA statement used (Total process time): &gt; &gt;real time 0.00 seconds &gt; &gt;cpu time 0.01 seconds &gt; &gt;90 &gt; &gt;91 %put #### &amp;report\_name\_data ####; &gt; &gt;\#### Jane #### &gt; &gt;92 %put #### &amp;report\_name\_space ####; &gt; &gt;\#### Jane #### &gt; &gt;93 &gt; &gt;94 OPTIONS NONOTES NOSTIMER NOSOURCE NOSYNTAXCHECK; &gt; &gt;104 &amp;#x200B;

Someone on /r/sas might know, but I would definitely reach out to SAS Tech Support for a question like this. They will not only know the answer cold, but it might prompt them to update the docs so that it is available for everyone. They are really quite good at answering these types of questions. 
Yes, &amp;#x200B; Check out [THIS](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrdict/64316/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a000178980.htm). &amp;#x200B; You might need to do some macro work to programmatically do all of a given file type given from a directory listing. 
Importing with an INFILE statement supports wildcards. Ill post an example when I get to my PC.
Thanks! 
I'm a fan of the Data Attribute maps, which is a relatively newer feature. You do have to specify the colours in advance, you can use hex codes if you know them. &amp;#x200B; Here's a short example, I simplified your example. Fill color is what controls the colour. data myColours; informat ID value fillcolor linecolor $20.; input ID $ value $ fillcolor $ linecolor $; cards; stk IBM CXaf8dc3 CXaf8dc3 stk Microsoft CXffffbf CXffffbf stk Intel CX7fbf7b CX7fbf7b ;;;; ods graphics / reset attrpriority=color; proc SGplot data=sashelp.stocks dattrmap=myColours; reg x=date y=high / nomarkers group=stock clm clmtransparency=0.6 attrid=stk; run; &amp;#x200B;

It looks like there might be a copy/paste issue happening. %SET looks like a macro, but I am 99% sure that SAS doesn't let you create macros with names of important SAS keywords (like SET, FREQ, PROC, etc.). I could be wrong. If you want to know what %SET is doing, you're going to have to look at the rest of the program to find a %MACRO statement. That's where %SET is being created. The line with the asterisk is a comment and should not be running in the query as it currently exists. %PUT in SAS doesn't "do" anything for data processing per se. What it does is print a line of text into the log. In this case, %PUT is printing the exact phrase "Column4 = (macro variable column4)" into your LOG. Basically it's a way to test that the macro variable &amp;column4 has been created properly and has the correct value. &amp;#x200B;
Thank you so much, this helps a ton. So I found a macro at the beginning that created %setColumn1 followed by “proc sql” and code that makes sense. It looks like the “(2,Column2)” part will be what’s used as variables in the macro. I’ll just need to copy/paste that query into this spot using 2 and Column2 instead of variables. It’s nice knowing I can ignore the other lines too as it won’t affect the data. 
Thinking more about your problem; Are you trying to combine all these files into 1 big dataset to be exported to a different location? Or are you just looking to bulk-move files from A to B?
Refer to https://support.sas.com/software/products/university-edition/faq/SAS_libname.htm . The key is that you put the file in the physical path you defined for "myfolders" in VirtualBox, and then in SAS University Edition, you reference it using the path **/folders/myfolders/&lt;filename&gt;**
Thank you. I'll give this a run :)
Try going through part of the coursera course or the SAS e-course. There’s also video tutorials if you learn that way. 
Is this an advertisement? lol
Yes, I'd say it is, and I for one feel cheated that I had to struggle along to get this far in my career without the benefit of SAS Institute Malaysia.
This entire sub is a sas shitshow lol. Time to unsubscribe
Marketing and/or industry bias. You'd probably already know that, though, considering this is clearly an ad. Protip: you probably don't need to sell SAS to people already on a SAS subreddit. Try branching out.
Seriously. 
Check the poster's history, it is.
It's not. It's going the way of the dinosaurs. The primary driver of its continued success is inertia in a select few industries. SAS did a great job advancing analytics and creating a strong community. But you can't compete with free, open sourced software with throngs of developers pumping out new packages at a rapid clip. But if you are, say, a startup, and decide to go with SAS? I question your decision making skills.
Yeah try selling it over at r/rstats and let me know how it goes. 
Is SAS really that valuable? I hate the program, honestly, and have to use it for school.
It's been a pretty valuable tool for me in my job. There are other tools that do similar things, but it is predictable and dependable, based on my experience. I didn't learn SAS in college -- just on the job. I never really found SAS Institute training that useful, either. Sitting in a classroom for a few days doesn't add much value. Getting on-the-job experience is much more valuable, as far as I'm concerned.
Thanks!
 %setColumn1(2,Column2); is a macro call statement that calls the macro called "SetColumn1" and passes to it, two arguments: the first argument is the number 2 and the second is "Column2." If you are seeing this inside a proc sql statement, then most likely this macro is being used to control certain aspects of the SQL Query (like which columns to use, options to envoke, ordering of output, etc.). When the macro call is seen inside the sql statement, the macro is called as the two parameters are passed to to it and then the macro creates output that must be compatible with the sql statement. This output is then inserted into that point of the code as if you had written that portion yourself and the rest of the proc sql statement is executed. Here's a toy example I wrote up. Say you wanted to select different columns from some table stored in work.temp based on the value of a flag (in this case, I've called it SelectFlag). Then you could have a program like this: `%setColumn1(SelectFlag, column_name);` `%if &amp;SelectFlag %eq 1 %then %do;` `select some_column1,select some_column2, select some_column3, select some_column4, &amp;column_name` `%end;` `%if &amp;SelectFlag %eq 2 %then %do;` `select some_Othercolumn1,select some_Othercolumn2, &amp;column_name` `%end;` `%mend` proc sql; create table work.temp as %setColumn(2, Column2) from work.BaseTable; quit; So basically what happens here is that the proc sql comment begins and SAS begins to allocate some memory and space for work.temp due to the "create table work.temp as" statement. The next line "%setColumn1(2, Column2)" invokes the %setColumn1 statement that appears at the top of the code and passes to it the value 2 and "Column2". Inside the macro, 2 and "Column2" are referred to by their macro variable names "SelectFlag" and "column\_name" where are provided in the first line of the macro statement. Inside the macro if SelectFlag equals 1 then SAS writes out " `select some_column1,select some_column2, select some_column3, select some_column4, Column2`" the macro ends and the rest of the sql statement completes so that the following is executed: `proc sql;` `create table work.temp as` **select some\_column1,select some\_column2, select some\_column3, select some\_column4, Column2** `from` `work.BaseTable;` `quit;` But, if, while the macro is running, the SelectFlag has a value of 2 as shown macro call then the same thing would occur only this output "`select some_Othercolumn1,select some_Othercolumn2, Column2`" would occur and the rest of the SQL would run, resulting in this proc sql statement: `proc sql;` `create table work.temp as` **select some\_Othercolumn1,select some\_Othercolumn2, Column2** `from` `work.BaseTable;` `quit;` That's all for the first item in your post. For the second item ( `* Column3=3 ‘column_desc’ as column_desc;` ), this is a comment and should have no effect on the output. In fact, this should appear in green font as a hint in the default SAS IDE with default options. Anything that comes after an asterisk until a semicolon is reached on a single line is considered a comment. For the third item in your post, `%put Column4=&amp;Column4;` all this does is output the value of the macro variable Column4 to the SAS output log. This is usually done while debugging. I hope this helps. &amp;#x200B;
A reproducible example of what your data looks like and some sample code are imperative. I wouldn't expect much help with that.
This isn't really a SAS question. It's a question about how your University has configured VirtualBox to work with its file system. You'd need to contact your computing team. We have no idea about the particular setup of your University's statistical computing environment.
This definitely helps. Thank you for the thorough explanation. I’ll likely have more questions about something else tomorrow.
