on the other hand, named functions have unexpected consequences sometimes: http://kangax.github.com/nfe/
Doesn't matter much unless [Bug 562996](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/showdependencytree.cgi?id=562996&amp;hide_resolved=1) is fixed. Oh, and [#578133 is the tracking bug associated with Are We Fast Yet?](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/showdependencytree.cgi?id=578133&amp;hide_resolved=1)
Though I was planning on using it, this doesn't accomplish what I am trying. The step your missing is the data has to be linked to a specific element, so I still need to be able to have each variable wrapped in a special ID so I can access it directly. This is the issue I am mainly focused on. I was hoping for a template engine that had this integrated, but it seems I will have to build my own library to accomplish this.
I wish they'd track memory consumption as well though.
First of all these are not two-dimensional arrays, they are arrays of objects (it would be a two-dimensional array if you were accessing items with links[x][y] instead of links[n]). Unless you have some helper data structure then the only way to solve this will be with regular traversal, something like: function getLinksForBookmark(links, bookmark) { var url = bookmark.url; var results = []; for (var i=links.length-1; i&gt;=0; i--) // going backwards avoids checking length on each iteration if (links[i].href == url) results.push(links[i]); return results; } var links = getLinksForBookmark(links, bookmarks[n]);
 bookmark_urls = []; i = 0; for each bookmark in bookmarks bookmark_urls[i++] = bookmark.url link_urls = []; i = 0; for each link in links link_urls[i++] = link.href bookmark_urls.sort() link_urls.sort() results = [] i = bookmark_urls.length-1 j = link_urls.length-1 while i&gt;=0 &amp;&amp; j&gt;=0 if bookmark_urls[i] == link_urls[j] results[results.length] = bookmark_urls[i] i--, j-- else if bookmark_urls[i] &lt; link_urls[j] j-- else i-- cool? It's mostly pseudocode, but I think you can get this.
Going by the OP's description this would be wrapped in another loop for `n`. You'd get O(n²) if you did that. That is terrible. Sort your structures or create a set-like object.
A little more complicated, but look at a Bloom Filter. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter
It arrays were actual arrays, this would be awesome, but they aren't...so this ends up being more code then needed. Here's my approach: var urls = {}, results = [], i = bookmarks.length; while(--i) { urls[bookmarks[I].url] = true; } i = links.length; while(--i) { if(urls[links[i].href]) results.push(links[i].href); } return results; Is this something that you would want to factor out into a more general case? Because you could turn this into a function where you pass in the two arrays and the two properties (as strings) that you want to compare.
It is in the nature of a URL to be a uniform resource locator. Therefore your data structure should be keyed by URLs at the top level, like this: var resources = { 'http://example.com/foo.html':{ bookmarks:['something', 'another thing'], links:['something', 'somehow'], }, 'http://example.com/bar.html':{ bookmarks:['something else', 'yet another thing'], links:['a thing', 'someone'], }, };
Those are obviously in the works as shown by the progress in the Minefield builds of Firefox. 
Now all we need is some sprites and collision detection, and javascript will be just as fast as my C64 from 1982.
My web browser (normally Chrome, sometimes Safari) is constantly using &gt;4GB of RAM. It is difficult to upgrade a laptop high enough that I don't find myself swapping a lot.
Speed is sacrificed because of memory! It's people like you slowing the damn browser down with crazy amounts of intricate memory handling and garbage collection.
ARGHHHHHH! They've broken hardware acceleration on tonight's nightly again. I wonder what's happening... it's on, then off, then on, then off... =( Some stress test programs... 4 FPS, 60 FPS, then 4 FPS, then 59.... Surely detecting if Direct2D is available doesn't need to be changed in nightly builds!? Damn! What if it ends on a version that doesn't work for me!?
Actually the OP's description is ambiguous and doesn't actually even make sense, eg in: (links[n].href == bookmarks[n].url), why are these both using the same index 'n'? 
Indeed. If it's possible to change the structure itself, it's better to use the URLs as keys. However, if the OP has retrieves the two arrays from different sources or if it's not possible to change the structure itself, he can still use JavaScript itself to transform the two arrays into a single resource object like you described: var associate = function(bookmarks, links, map){ var b = bookmarks.length, l = links.length, entry; map = map || {}; while (b--){ var bookmark = bookmarks[b]; entry = map[bookmark.url] || (map[bookmark.url] = { bookmarks: [], links: [] }); entry.bookmarks.unshift(bookmark.name); } while (l--){ var link = links[l]; entry = map[link.href]; if (entry) entry.links.unshift(link.text); } return map; }; var resources = associate(bookmarks, links); 
Very true, but they still have to finish before Fx4 for it to "matter"... or am I reading that bug the wrong way?
They aren't. I simply have *n* links and *n* bookmarks...
about:support (Help --&gt; Troubleshooting Information) will tell you how many "GPU Accelerated Windows" you have and what method is used at the bottom of the page. You can use the [Grafx Bot extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/200733/) to send detailed data to Mozilla generated from a bunch of (semi-)automated tests, that might help them. The [database with the results is also open](http://brasstacks.mozilla.com/halreftest/data/).
You could take two seconds to find independent benchmarks, assuming you know how to use google I guess.
Unfortunately I think many of the fixes for IE will slow down your clean implementation.
Have you seen [Socket.io](http://socket.io/)?
I wasn't aware you knew how much RAM my machine has. Thing is, I have a job to do, and in this job memory is the major constraining factor, not CPU. Which language platforms are viable are partly determined by how well they use memory. Your limited imagination being unable to fathom Javascript for more than manipulating a DOM is not my problem.
Looks cool. I live in firebug so I always enjoy updates.
Fair question.. MS itself had some kind of benchmark thingy showing the latest IE9 being at least as fast as Safari in SunSpider: http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/benchmarks/sunspider/default.html Neowin tried to reproduce pretty much the same sunspider benchmark, and found IE9 was significantly faster than FF 3.6, but still slower than Safari: http://www.neowin.net/news/internet-explorer-9-beta-benchmarked-how-does-it-stack-up 
As I mentioned over at that [other thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/dtmji/looking_for_clientsided_templating_which/), jQuery's tmpl thingy cannot preserve white space. Usually this isn't an issue though.
you should say links[*n*].href == bookmarks[*m*].url then, or it's confusing
&lt;3 you! Thanks! Are you any part of the FF dev team?
Best lib just got better
I guess you're right. Although I feel the need to defend my mistake by explaining to you that this was written on Saturday (it's like Sunday morning for the normal world) at around [6]am
WAIT A SECOND every time this is running for (var i = 0; i &lt; items.length; ++i) { items.length gets to evaluate again and again? WOW! I must admit that you example looks a little bit hard to read at first, but after understanding what stands behind it, it sure looks *nicer*. It's a little hard to understand at first, so I wonder if it's worth the effort (any benchmarks on this issue? I wonder...) Regarding you answer, like alanplum mentioned, I would need to go over the array for every single bookmark I have, and this would be very inefficient, afaik. Though your way of doing a *for* loop was worth it :)
You're welcome, hope it helped in some way. And no, I have no relation to the dev team or the Mozilla foundation or corporation for that matter.
[It's not like this was posted ONE DAY AGO or anything.](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/dvbs0/how_to_not_suck_at_jquery)
Glad you found it useful even if it's not exactly what you wanted. There is a speedup in not checking items.length each time, it's due to the engine having to resolve a variable (items) then resolve a property (length), instead of having a coded number; the engine has to do this as the loop might have modified items or items.length (note the engine probably doesn't have to *recalculate* length, just resolve it). It's not an extremely large performance; it's far more important to get the overall algorithm efficient (in this case pre-sorting etc.) than these micro optimisations, but if it's in a tight loop you can measure a difference. If you need to go in an increasing order then you can "cache" the length, eg: for (var i=0, L=items.length; i&lt;L; i++)
maybe try http://www.renderengine.com/index.php I haven't used it because I discovered it too late, but it seems nice
You could try Box2Djs for physics/collision and either RaphaelJS (SVG) or CakeJS (Canvas) for graphics. http://box2d-js.sourceforge.net/ http://raphaeljs.com/ http://glimr.rubyforge.org/cake/canvas.html 
I wrote up this argument for why using unshift is a bad idea, but then I realized that would only be an issue if you had 100's of bookmarks or links with the same URL...which would be really dumb and rare.
Just as a heads up, JSONP-Fu now has YQL support, thanks again for the suggestion!
Maybe have a go with plain JS? When I was looking for an excuse to try out Canvas, I ended up writing a little Asteroids-a-like. It was actually much easier than I thought, despite having precisely zero games programming experience. The whole thing took about a day and ended up coming in at under 500 lines (although I'll admit it's not the best implementation, and missing a few things). For a simple game (which most of the old vector ones are) I think it's perfectly feasible to use plain JS.
Cake has some great demos but it appears to be unmaintained at the moment.
I went to a meet up about [Akihabara](http://www.kesiev.com/akihabara/). I haven't touched it since though so I can't give you a good review of how good it is. It seemed really simple to use though. 
Not much to say ... All the exciting stuff is in 0.3 
Yep. Likewise for Box2Djs, I think. It hasn't had an update since 2008. Raphael is very modern and up-to-date though.
Yea. Raphael looks the business. Maybe SVG performance will be the new browser performance battleground. I could live with that.
Emulated mouse events are really clumsy. They happen only when you actually lift your finger, and you get mouseenter, mousedown, mouseup, click, mouseleave pretty much all at once. It feels very slow. With touch events, you can listen for touchstart, touchmove, and touchend, which all happen when you'd expect them to.
If click events did not work then most web pages would not work on the iPhone, and they clearly do. If you are specifically interested in mousedown/touchstart then you should listen to those events. If you just want to know that a user activated a link or button then the click event is all you need.
There's a noticeable difference in response difference between click and touchstart.
Generally speaking, JavaScript is used in web browsers to transform the page contents in some way. Of course this is usually done by including or referencing script code in the page itself. It sounds like you are more interested in running your own JavaScript code to transform how other webpages appear in your browser... If that's the case, there are quite a few ways to make this happen. Bookmarklets, userscripts, and extensions all work on this principle, although the first two are probably the best way to get started. A bookmarklet is a bookmark you can create in your browser where the URL starts with "javascript:", just like in your example. If you're familiar with JavaScript, it's pretty easy to take some code, cram it all on one line, put javascript: in front and paste it into a bookmark URL (or right into the address bar, same effect). You might try googling for something like "how to write a bookmarklet" for more information, or ask if you run into more specific questions. Userscripts are another way to accomplish running your own code against a webpage. Originally they were made to run in Firefox using the Greasemonkey extension, but they're now also supported natively in Chrome. You specify a name for your script and the webpages it should run on, and your code will be automatically run anytime you visit that page. There are tons of contributed scripts at http://userscripts.org, and it looks like they have a decent getting-started guide at http://userscripts.org/guides/22 Not sure if this exactly answered your question but hopefully it's at least helpful.
Yes! Thank you very much! "Bookmarklet" is the term that I did not know and was looking for. Hopefully this will make my googling for tutorials and examples much easier now :) Thanks again!
Internally where I work we have Resig's original templating system. Take a look at http://jsperf.com/dom-vs-innerhtml-based-templating/30 You might be surprised at just how much of a difference we are talking about here in terms of performance between templating languages. It might be years before the official template can beat jQote2 in performance or reach something else like Eco. Additionally, the official template is now significantly slower than the original Resig micro-template from the benchmarks I saw. If you stick with the official releases you might be waiting a month or nearly a year as was the case for 1.4.2 to 1.4.3. It might not even be possible for them to achieve those performance levels. There is the issue of syntax that might be a bigger concern than anything else too. I'd say almost every template has some degree of syntax difference. You might be a fan of haml, like myself, and not care what the performance benefits are (it actually is faster than the original). Ultimately, you should decide how much use of client-side templates you need, whether you can alter the templates in the future, and how maintainable/easy/logical the template syntax is.
try the wikipedia page for bookmarklet
When you're done with simple little scripts, and you are ready to write full applications in Javascript, read [this book](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742).
Follow that with [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Performance-JavaScript-Faster-Application-Interfaces/dp/059680279X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1288039873&amp;sr=8-1-spell)
Reposted from /r/programming (which I think was the wrong reddit)
I'm sure that you are right. But the original point I made still stands. If the posted app were responsive to the click event then it would support all devices. Not just those that fire touch events.
@picurl, the issue is you're assuming a browser context is present... by default in the browser this == window, but even that may not be so, when in say the firebug console... using the undefined test with var is the only way to attach to global.... (window || this).mysite || {} would work though...
while() is faster.
On which engine? I've never measured a speed increase with while, and I don't see why there should be one, it's a different syntax for what is actually the same execution tree.
see http://peter.michaux.ca/articles/an-important-pair-of-parens (among others) has to do with automatic function execution
Style preferences aside, the one reason why you must start that with a parenthesis is that it's a requirement from the language grammar. Basically, the grammar defines statements and expressions. A function definition can be either, but will behave differently in each case. A function definition as a statement doesn't have a value. It merely states "There is a named function, and this is its code". The only way you can use that function is to refer to it by name. A function definition as an expression doesn't have to be named, and can be used within a bigger expression. So what does that have to do with parenthesis? Well, according to the language grammar, if a statement begins with a parenthesis, that statement is actually an expression. That's enough to tell the language that the function definition that follows isn't just a function statement, which allows you to make it an anonymous function, and to call it directly.
Just to elaborate on one of the reason why people jump through these hoops: names evaluated inside the anonymous function are local to the scope of the function, not the outer context. This makes it hard to accidentally pollute the namespace of the global (or merely enclosing) scope.
javascript has global and function scope. the reason for the code you're asking about is to create a new scope. it looks wierd the first time you see it, but once you get the scoping rules it makes sense
It's a self-executing function that creates a closure. [Most commonly used in a module pattern](http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/06/12/module-pattern/). The extra parentheses around the function definition are mostly syntactic sugar, but ensure that different JS engines interpret the function execution correctly.
Should be written like this: (function (text) { var x = 5; alert(text + x); // hello world5 }('hello world')); alert(typeof x); // undefined The wrapping parens should wrap the whole thing. Basically, you create some function and execute it right away. The wrapping parens aren't necessary in all cases, but they should be always there to indicate that you execute that function right off the bat. E.g. if you see: `x = function () {` It looks like you assign a function to a variable. However, if you stumble upon something like this: `}();` at the end... you have been fooled. With the parens in place you can see right away that that function's return value is assigned to that variable and not that function. I highly recommend to create a snippet/abbreviation for this kind of thing if your text editor/IDE allows it. For example if I type "funcw" in Komodo and hit ctrl+t, it's expanded to: (function () { | }()); It's correctly indented and my cursor is also at that '|' position. Very very handy.
Actually, they are both fine places to post this link. It is very relevant to both JavaScript and programming in general. Thanks for sharing.
 (function() { var x = 0; this.publicFunction = function() { alert(x++); }; })(); The function is executed immediately. the variable x is local to the anonymous function. publicFunction and other functions still can access it due to being created in the same scope. The pattern avoids polluting the global state and also encapsulates its content. This is why it is often called the "module pattern". edit: "this" in the example refers to the global object, usually "window" in a browser context.
Linting your JS will yell at you for not providing the radix parameter for this very reason. :)
The first set of parens tells other developers the function is being executed immediately. You can run: function () { alert('hi reddit'); } () But it's hard to tell what's going on especially after the body of the function gets filled up. With the parens: (function () { alert('hi reddit'); }) () It's clearer that the expression is a function (kind of like you'd find in Scheme or a Lisp). The second set executes the function right away and can take arguments like any named function: var s = 'hi reddit'; (function(s) { alert(s); }) (s) &gt; When a function is to be invoked immediately, the entire invocation expression should be wrapped in parens so that it is clear that the value being produced is the result of the function and not the function itself. from [Code Conventions for the JavaScript Programming Language](http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html) I found [Show love to the Module Pattern](http://www.wait-till-i.com/2007/07/24/show-love-to-the-module-pattern/) helpful too. So, basically what everyone else said.
it seems the best thing would be for mozilla to hire the firebug team lead and incorporate it into their browser. pretty much the only thing keeping me on firefox currently is firebug, in every other aspect I make use of chrome wins. please mozilla, don't let this gem die.
If you can download it now, that means they beat Adobe Edge to market.
&gt; couldn't you avoid that by writing an object? Yes and no. In terms of purely isolating it from the outside, yes. One reason is syntax, IMHO it's much nicer to write (function (){ foo = "bar"; alert(foo); })(); than var MyApp = { foo: "bar" ,sayFoo: function (){ alert(MyApp.foo); } MyApp.sayFoo(); (or something like that) Another thing though is that it is a way to pass things into and out of our enclosed scope much more easily. for example: (function (window, someglobalvar, undefined){ //do some stuff here... //create some obj called bazz... var bazz = {}; //attach it to global window object window.bazz = bazz; //modify global object someglobalvar += 5; })(window, globalvar); See how we can reach into and out of our enclosed scope by passing certain arguments to the self-executing function? That's harder to do with an object literal, or even impossible in some cases. You can use this self-executing function technique to return an object that has the properties you want as well. var fizz = (function (){ return {}; })(); You can also see a little trick jQuery uses. Our function takes 3 arguments, the last one is called "undefined". However when we call the function, we only pass 3 values...in JS any argument that does not get passed gets undefined instead. This has two benefits: 1) A small speed increase since undefined is now in local scope 2) If someone overwrites undefined with some weird value it won't bork your code. &gt; execute the function automagically (when "it's" ready... it? the dom? js engine?) There's not much magic involved. It just executes it right away. (function (){})(); is the same as: function foo(){} foo();
 var s = "08"; var n = +s; alert( n === 8); 
Update: This looked interesting, and I downloaded it, but it requires a Sencha forum account to start up. An additional warning: it adds a desktop icon on Linux. On the plus side, their uninstall script seems to work perfectly. I think it is tragic that a company specializing in desktop-like web applications didn't release this tool as a web application. &gt;For those of you wondering what Sencha Animator is written in, the answer is… Ext JS of course! Ext JS provided an enormous short-cut in development time and allowed us to deliver the product on multiple platforms without worrying about Objective-C or Windows APIs. They wrote it with JavaScript, and you still have to download, install, and register the trial version. ಠ_ಠ
Same. I only fire up Firefox purely for Firebug. 
That was probably just as a convenience factor, and so that you can save your work client side. Hard to say, given that the Sencha login pretty much stopped my interest dead. They didn't even provide a registration link on the dialog. Sloppy!
&gt;developing support for full Firebug on other browsers, including mobile weee!! I'm looking forward to this :) Thanks Firebug Team, keep up!
I'm going to sound like a retard, but... &gt; shifting from open source to collaborative source What is the difference?
OpenSource doesn't necessarily mean that they let anyone outside the dev team have anything to do with the code short of what is required by the license they're using.
Gotcha. Thanks!
I've actually converted to Chrome Dev Tools, it's more or less as good as firebug and a little easier to use once you get used to it.
I agree, the dev tools built into safari and chrome just don't compare to firebug.
Sometimes I find the net tab in firebug to be a little better. Also, when debugging in Chrome I've had the tools crash on me. Also, sometimes it's hard to hover over an object in JS and read it's properties without the popup window closing. These things have me going back to Firebug a lot even though I'd much rather stay in Chrome 100%. 
i love chrome, but the dev tools leave a lot to be desired. firebug's css editing interface is literally a thousand times better. the console is better, especially the dropdown XHR calls. the DOM tab is invaluable for troubleshooting. the NET tab is easier to use. Firebug is the single best thing to ever happen to web development, and it makes every single day of my life better than it was without it. this doubling down is EXCELLENT news!
&gt;We’re pricing standard edition like a traditional design tool: on a per user basis in the low hundreds of dollars. teehee
That's not an issue.
For an assignment I am making a website 'navigatable' by controlling the character. What do you think? Any feedback or reason why IE7 hates it would be appreciated. Oh and I used some sprites from lovable Minecraft.
**Yet.** That's important. Given that they are built in, and have huge commercial backing, for Firebug to stay ahead it's going to be a huge challenge. Every Chromium beta I test, the dev tools do more and more things that I would have had to rely on Firebug for. Sometimes, I even forget I'm using Chromium and not Firebug/Firefox. It takes me until I find a gap in the featureset before I decide I should fire up firebug. As time goes by, it takes me longer and longer before this happens.
A lot of the firebug working group [already does work for mozilla](http://getfirebug.com/getinvolved) or already have gainful employment elsewhere. In some of those cases part of their job may actually *be* working on firebug for internal reasons.
It's an anonymous self-executing function.
How so? For the past 6 months or so I've found Chrome's Dev Tools to be much better than Firebug's.
It's just strange syntax. You are declaring an 'anonymous function'(just a function with no reference) and then calling it. This would be useless in most languages but since functions are the only thing that define a scope in javascript this can be used to shield your code from the global namespace. In java this would be the same as "{...}". BTW, I think the example you posted is actually wrongish since it passes a variable to the function(foo) but the function doesn't take any parameters. It will still run, I think, but there's no point in that 'foo'. P.S. Everything I know about javascript I learned from experience and Doug Crockford.
This was fantastic. I hope they keep creating these lists. #10 the Changelog interview with Thomas Fuchs was quite good.
I love this comment from jwz: &gt; Brendan's house and my nightclub thank us for selling out early and often. Gold.
Also, only Firebug has CSS property Autocomplete. It's much faster and less buggy to make CSS edits in Firebug. And, Firebug supports plugins. At the current pace, I doubt Chrome dev tools will really catch up within the next couple years. However, it's still really the only reason I use Firefox.
Chrome has property autocomplete, for css and js, in the console, as well. Won't disagree with CSS edits but for the most part chrome does it sufficiently, only plugin I've ever found necessary for Firebug was yslow. There's a plugin for chrome, [speed tracer](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/speedtracer/index.html) that does a fair job.
if you need to cast a string to number in JS, just multiply by one. Great for the cases where you know you have a string containing a number and don't want a lot of parse Ints/Floats in the code.
Thanks for introducing me to inotify, it looks pretty cool. Never knew that existed.
I should be more specific. Chrome does not autocomplete the *values* of CSS properties. It's rare that I have to add new CSS in the browser, I'm usually just editing existing CSS. Firebug knows valid CSS values, which is enough to keep me using it. Also, the Web Developer toolbar with quick links to Validate Generated (Local) HTML/CSS is very useful. Does such a tool exist on Chrome?
We did! Here is [episode two](http://badassjs.com/post/1417405454/today-in-js-episode-two).
&gt;Also, the Web Developer toolbar with quick links to Validate Generated (Local) HTML/CSS is very useful. Does such a tool exist on Chrome? Yep there are a few good options: [HTML Validator](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/cgndfbhngibokieehnjhbjkkhbfmhojo/) [Web Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/bfbameneiokkgbdmiekhjnmfkcnldhhm) [Pendule](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/gbkffbkamcejhkcaocmkdeiiccpmjfdi) 
There are so many ways that firebug beats chrome dev tools.. I develop web applications all day, every day, and firebug is the hands-down winner. Sure, I use chrome dev tools often when I have to debug something chrome (or safari) specific, but it pains me to use their dev tools. I can enter values on-the-fly in the HTML tab in firebug and the changes instantaneously update on the page, while in chrome dev tools I must hit enter before any update is made - and this slows me down A LOT when i'm tweaking pixel values, etc. That is one small way that firebug is better, and I can't live without it. Firebug can live in it's own window - and I have 6 screens, firebug gets an entire screen to iteslf. Chrome dev tools is stuck at the bottom of the browser, eating into my browser window. The DOM inspector is better in firebug by far, as well as practically every other feature. I can't think of any way that chrome dev tools beat firebug, not one. 
I'm a full time web dev as well, though I'm more concerned about Javascript than CSS and ime chrome's javascript debugging and console is much more useable and stable (granted it's been 9 months since I've switched to Dev Tools full time so maybe firebug has fixed my problems.) Don't get me wrong I love firebug and acknowledge its superiority in more cases, the thing is that Chrome, the browser, is way better than firefox, so rather than constantly switch browsers for firebug I learnt Chrome Dev Tools and have found it is, for the vast majority of the time, an acceptable substitute. I don't know when the last time you used Chrome Dev Tools but it can be in an individual window as well, for a while now.
This is like reading an MSDN comparison of Windows vs Linux.
 * Douglas Crockford : AFAIK douglas doesn't work on YUI. Don't know about the other guys. * CDN delivery : jQuery has it too. * Mature, consistent evolution between releases : Well they broke everything with YUI3... I can hardly call that a success. jQuery in the other hand has done a quite good job at being stable and not breaking too much code. * Varied and comprehensive documentation: I guess it's a matter of taste but I prefer jQuery documentation. * Performance optimisation: 7kb? What can you do with that? If you need to load 200kb afterwards it hardly a win. * YUI Compressor: can use that with jQuery if you want. * Console: point taken. jQuery could benefit from a sort of simple official console plugin that abstract browser differences like opera.postError, mozilla.console.log or absence of any of it (IE? Webkit?). It's what jQuery is for: abstracting browsers functionalities that have different implementation.
&gt;Recently I had the opportunity to build my first JavaScript front end application. ... &gt;In the interest of full disclosure, my own experience up to this point had been in developing small, standalone solutions, the type of which you could typically describe as plugins. These included dynamic UI components such as image carousels, interactive maps and Twitter / Flickr widgets. ... &gt;About the Author: Mark is a Senior Front End Developer at VI, a multi-disciplinary communications agency established in 1981 with a design orientation. How the hell did you pull a senior position?
&gt; Having had little experience in code organisation, my code quickly became disorganised, inefficient and repetitive. That's the one that got me. Programming for 30 years and don't know how to organize code?! That's like the 2nd chapter in every beginner's programming book.

Awesome, thanks!
It's interesting the animosity in the comments toward this article/YUI. Is it just that we are all wildly allegiant to jQuery? The point is, and I felt like the article made it clear, that jQuery and YUI solve fundamentally different problems. jQuery is amazing for a lot of stuff, nearly anything I come in contact with day-to-day, but it's no secret it's not a tool designed to organize large applications. Yes, you absolutely can build standalone complex javascript applications using jQuery, but so can you build it with plain javascript. It comes down to how much organization and bookkeeping you want to do yourself. For single page applications with a lot of components, YUI does provide better tools to build with. And that's good, if jQuery tried to do all the things YUI does, it would be bloated, more difficult to pick up, and overall worse at it's main goal of simplifying JavaScript/DOM. I guess what I'm saying is jQuery is great, YUI is great, a lot of other frameworks are great (some are not) Try to find the best tool for the job, and don't hate on people who use different tools, and different requirements.
The variable 'pipelineurl' is being set to a different value as you're going through the loop. The problem is that you're referring to that variable in a function closure on line 62. So all those function closures that are being created in a loop are referring to the same object. Here's a simple example illustrating the same concept: ... pipelineurl = "your mama"; var alertURL = function() { alert(pipelineurl); } pipelineurl = "something else"; alertURL(); // will alert "something else" ... So here's the fix, create a new function to which you pass 'y' and in that function, make your ajax call and whatever else you're doing: for(var y=38;y&lt;=133;y++) { makePipelineRow(y); } function makePipelineRow(y) { var pipelinevalue = y; var pipelineurl = "http://10.39.166."+pipelinevalue+"/command.cgi?status" $.ajax(...); ... }
The (function (x) { ... })(x); format is correct.
you have $jQuery(function( $){ it should be jQuery(function($){ notice the "$" is missing from jQuery. That's the only change. That looks like your first problem. Also, you have $("#navigation").localScrol().hash({}); hash() isnt a function. It looks like you are wanting to set the hash property to true so in that case you should have jQuery(function( $ ){ $.localScroll.defaults.axis = 'x'; $('#navigation').localScroll({ hash:true }); });
also, more importantly, your way of coding this (and the fix provided) will run all the ajax requests at the same time. that's a lot of requests to your server all at once. better would be to make them happen 1 at a time. you can do this using a stack to push the requests on, then pop them off and deal with them, popping another when you're done with 1. Or without even modifying your code at all you can just make your ajax calls synchronous. This will end up halting your javascript from continuing running while the request happens, so the first idea is probably better.
_look_of_disapproval_ looks like \_of\_ is italicized too. explain better, please.
LOL. I'm upvoting this for maximum embarrassment for you. 
This: &gt; Javascript is only non blocking in situations where &gt; you are dispatching off to the browser do to something. &gt; In that situation, the browser is spawning a XmlHttpRequest &gt; on a separate thread. I can do the same thing in VB6 using WinHTTP. It doesn't make VB6 multithreaded. Even the callback is executed on the same thread as I started on. &gt; However, you cannot do this in your own code. There is no &gt; way to take an arbitrary task and run it asynchronously &gt; without blocking. &gt; This is why there is the WebWorkers spec for HTML5. 
Reminded me of this blog entry: http://ejohn.org/blog/how-javascript-timers-work/ It's a fine illustration through a feature on how JS is single threaded and blocking. Here is a excerpt: &gt;Since JavaScript can only ever execute one piece of code at a time (due to its single-threaded nature) each of these blocks of code are "blocking" the progress of other asynchronous events. This means that when an asynchronous event occurs (like a mouse click, a timer firing, or an XMLHttpRequest completing) it gets queued up to be executed later (how this queueing actually occurs surely varies from browser-to-browser, so consider this to be a simplification).
The funny thing is how angry Not_Edward_Bernays is about this.
This is rad. Maximum upboat.
I think /r/javascript may have been the wrong place to complain. Maybe /r/butthurt ... Even though you gave a very clear an friendly response.
I think Edward_Bernays expected you all to dogpile on me, instead of agree, otherwise why would he post it here? 
huh.. you're right.. looks like I misread Reddit's recent blog posting on that... HUZZAH! Day is saved by your sanity check. Wow.. thanks..
Oh, he's even trying to bury now. Nice. Wonder how he'll react to the quote from John? Clearly that guy doesn't know anything about JS. ;)
when I am waiting for a url to fetch, I can still interact with the browser. so it is not really blocking. in the c# example, if he doesn't do all of his bullshit, then it really will block him and it will be obvious that it is. 
You are an idiot. 
It depends on how Archive(FetchUrl()) in the C# example works internally. For example, it may spawn a thread and do all the work in that thread, and return immediately (ala, how DOM operations work in a browser). This doesn't take C# 5. You could do that with C# 1.0 I don't think you understood the article at all. 
&gt; This is an excerpt from my work-in-progress book: Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja. To be released Fall 2008. ...still waiting
looks like your shift key is blocked
no, I am still fucking right. the browser does not block while downloading data for AJAX. that's what I said, that's what you all have confirmed. what they are trying to achieve in that C# example is something javascript in the browser does without any weird code. so it is exactly as I characterized it, especially in this example, they are trying to catch up with javascript. I never said the UI code runs on multiple threads. if I could have less respect or more animosity towards you pieces of shit I would. 
&gt; if I could have less respect or more animosity towards you pieces of shit I would. I believe the feeling's mutual.
LOL WHY YOU MAD THO
Man, you have to realize after a while that even though you may have some valid points (XHR can be either asynchronous or synchronous, and Web Workers run on separate threads, etc), NO ONE is going to want to talk to you or side with you with when you have such a piss poor attitude. Think of a crazy man yelling on the street corner, repeating "THE EARTH IS ROUND, MOTHERFUCKERS!". It doesn't matter how correct the person is.. if the message is being delivered in such a crazy way, no one is going to want to listen or interact with you. This is just how things are, and eventually you're going to have to realize, if even to keep a stable job, that you have to at least APPEAR to be a normal person. (as a side note, there's definitely a bad side to this - people dressed up with a confident air are more likely to be believed, regardless of the content of their message. That's why there's so many cocksure people who rise so fast in the business world.)
actually on second look something funky is still going on... looks like reddit behaves differently with * and _ ... ugh! \*foo\*bar\*baz\* = *foo*bar*baz* \_foo\_bar\_baz\_ = _foo_bar_baz_
I take it you haven't heard of BeginInvoke and EndInvoke? Action a = new Action(() =&gt; { // some blocking operation }); // run async, invokes callback when done a.BeginInvoke(cb =&gt; a.EndInvoke(cb), null); This is no different than the javascript example. You start something executing, and when it's done, it calls a callback. In javascript, the callback is the [onreadystatechange](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/xmlhttprequest#Properties) callback. They are the exact same in principal, just different in execution. Also, XmlHttpRequest does not mean asynchronous, it just is by default. you can have a blocking XHR request.
&gt;what they are trying to achieve in that C# example is something javascript in the browser does without any weird code Not at all. C# has supported the handling asynchronous calls by providing callbacks since 1.0, and it's supported doing so through closures since 2.0. What is outlined in this example for 5.0 is not at all possible in javascript. You completely missed the point of the video.
*whoosh*
Can someone explain what is going on here? You can spawn timers and XMLHTTPRequests but the execution of their callback function will be single threaded. I don't get what is going on here? And I also thought it was true that you can have up to two simultaneous http requests to the same domain only?
1. That what makes this funny. 2. You can have multiple (more than 2 even) simultaneous http requests to the same domain, JS however blocks while it is executing.
http://www.manning.com/resig/ You can read (most of) it now.
My first impression was to upvote this to further embarrass Not_Edward_Bernays when he eventually realises that he has missed the point. After reading his comments, however, I changed my mind. No one needs to see shit like this.
In both browser-based JS and node.js, IO is passed off to modules written in C or C++, meanwhile JS loops and hangs out and is free to do other stuff. Yes, this is non-blocking and asynchronous and all that good stuff. But what I think these good C# folks are trying to say is that with C#, this capability is not implemented as separate modules which are then bolted onto the implementation and exposed through a callback-driven API, but rather are a core *part* of the language, and have been factored into the language design at a core level in such a way as to be somehow more convenient. It's a C# thing, you have to just let it go man.
Yup. The announcement stated that as well. I'm sure the idea is that sometimes, you *do* want to italicize something in the middle of a word.

Well, you _could_ use `eval`, if you really really had to - `if (eval(arg+'Loaded')==true)`, but just typing that feels dirty. Seriously, why not use an array? If you've got 3 similar variables, an array is the way to go. var stuffLoaded = [false, false, false]; function thingymajig(arg) { var isLoaded = stuffLoaded[arg]; // rest of function } Looks a lot cleaner already.
will your array idea work if arg is not a number for the index? I simplified my example, there is going to end up with a lot more than three, but what if the argument was country names and I wanted to check brazilLoaded, chinaLoaded, japanLoaded how would I know what index in my stuffLoaded array to check? also what is the evil in using eval?
if(window[arg + 'Loaded'] === true) { isLoaded = true }
Why would you do it this way, instead of: stuffLoaded['one'] = true; stuffLoaded['two'] = false; stuffLoaded['three'] = true; function isLoaded (whichThing) { return stuffLoaded[whichThing]; } Heck, at this point even the isLoaded function is almost extraneous.
Sure, it'll work, you just have to use a different declaration: var stuffLoaded = { brazil: false, china: false, japan: false, }; From there you can access the information either like this (property syntax): if (stuffLoaded.brazil == true) { ... } Or like this (array syntax) if (stuffLoaded['brazil'] == true) { ... } Using the array syntax you could go like this (stupid example): function baconize(arrrrrg) { stuffLoaded[arrrrrg] = true; } baconize('brazil'); As for why `eval` is considered evil, it's because it's an incredibly resource-hungry function that can easily be overused and create massive security flaws. 99.99999%* of the time, you don't need it, and there is a better way of handling the same problem. It's best to just ignore its existence. \* The only time I remember having to use eval was for a function plotter with a user-supplied function, many moons ago.
I was going to post this, but I also realized that if you want to be really picky.. all of your variables should not exist in the global scope, if any. ;)
thanks for the explanation :)
This is what I was after, the only way I knew of interacting with arrays was with index and my data isn't numerical. Thanks :)
The weird thing about Javascript is that it doesn't actually support associative arrays. What you're making is an object that has extremely similar behavior. You can access it two ways: stuffLoaded.one is the same as stuffLoaded['one'] ... but obviously the latter affords for easier variable substitution. you could explicitly define it, too, like this: var stuffLoaded = { one: true, two: false, three: true, } That's the same thing as: stuffLoaded['one'] = true; stuffLoaded['two'] = false; stuffLoaded['three'] = true;
I downloaded and built node, and it's been a fun ride so far. I think the platform holds a lot of promise and I'll be using it long into the future, probably as my server-side weapon of choice, once it matures sufficiently. But the hype bubble will burst soon. There will be (already is) a backlash by disgruntled C#/Java/Python/Ruby/PHP/Perl programmers who (perhaps unfairly) see the node.js community as a bunch of kids running around waving toy guns, whereas they fancy themselves battle-hardened war veterans. I worry about relatively content-free hype articles such as this. What the node community needs right now is less hype, and more users finding and reporting bugs, and sharing ideas for improvement in the node discussion group. Okay done ranting.
[eval is evil](http://xkr.us/js/eval) Also, referencing global variables is easily done through the global object, which is the window object in a browser environment. window.foo === window["foo"]
don't parse HTML with regular expressions. n000000000000000000000000b
Check out Saki's examples here: http://examples.extjs.eu/ Also, check out his Blog. LOTS of helpful tips there. http://blog.extjs.eu/tag/extjs/ 
(function+invocation) vs (function)+invocation The former makes more sense and it also works in AS3 for example (the latter doesn't).
Why would you use eval? a global variable sits in the scope of "window". You can access it as: window.oneLoaded, or as window['oneLoaded']. So the entire code is simply: isLoaded = (window[arg + 'Loaded'] === true); 
Resig is seriously my hero. jQuery took the agony which was JavaScript development and made it crazy fun. Too fun really. Seriously, I have a problem I can't stop finding excuses to use jQuery in everything I build. The default HTML templates in my editors now have jQuery and jQueryUI baked in even.
Code size is nothing to do with efficiency.
it's your use of the greedy quantifier (.+) as opposed to the lazy version (.+?) Read these: [Repetition](http://www.regular-expressions.info/repeat.html) [Possessive Quantifiers](http://www.regular-expressions.info/possessive.html)
Other thoughts: -Why use [^ \S] which means "not a not a space".. just use a lowercase \s to represent a space.. -Possessive quantifiers are faster than greedy and lazy quantifiers - to match \*foo\* the fastest, use: /\*([^\*]++)\*/g I think this is improved.. var replace_str = " &lt;em&gt;$1&lt;/em&gt;"; text = text.replace(/\*([^\*]++)\*/g, replace_str).replace(/(?:^|\s)_(.+)_/g, replace_str); 
Event model is one thing, just off the top of my head. Zepto is meant for mobile browsers, and they all support addEventListener. Not using Sizzle is probably another huge part.
[Zepto.js](http://zeptojs.com/) @ 2k: mobile WebKit browsers [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/) @ 12k: various device native browsers, opera mobile 8.5+, opera mini 4 &amp; 5, fennec, ozone, netfront, phonegap [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) @ 26k: IE6+, FF2+, Safari 3+, Opera 9+, Chrome hence the size differences *edit: formatting*
I list "writing jQuery plug-ins" as one of my favorite hobbies
Just a heads up - jQuery Mobile has jQuery as a dependency. So people will necessarily be loading at least 38k up front.
Man, that's an impressive list. Even Mozilla doesn't properly support Fennec.
That depends what you mean by efficient. Average page load time is an important factor that is effected by code size. For some users 26K will mean the page loads 1 second slower, that can be significant.
&gt;For some users 26K will mean the page loads 1 second slower, that can be significant. Maybe if you're on a 56k modem.
Has anyone actually found that a 26k JS file is causing poor performance on mobile browsers before they got so hot and bothered about it? Seems like a massive waste of time since phones will catch up to the equivalent speed of old PCs within, what, 1.5x generations? A year?
var youAre={ n00000000000000000b: false}; youAre['n00000000000000000b'] = true; So, as you can see.... youAre['n00000000000000000b'] is true.
Or a mobile.
And btw: If you're accessing them statically like in those last 3 lines, you probably should write: stuffLoaded.one = true; Strings are pretty fast in javascript (especially v8) but doing it this way is still a bit faster, afaik.
One question at a time, jQuery n00000000000000000b! 
And then you forget one of those *console.log*s, and you code completely breaks in IE, and you can't figure out why (unless you know about this problem). **console.debug** is better anyway, it takes any type as a parameters, like an object or an array.
debug isn't any better than log, info, warn or error. Just different levels of writing to the console, they can all take any type as a param.
console doesn't work by default with FF. In fact, it breaks FF's normal process if you use console. This alone makes me want to use something else.
It's also not possible in IE7, which is almost always the only place I actually need a debug output. Even in IE8 it throws an error if you don't have the console actually open at the time the code executes.
The 1 line of code I included in the post should address the issue of not having a console open when you try to run console.log('')
Please tell me it's a joke.
Programmers still need to be told to use console.log()?
Actually, JS consoles are fairly new (compared to the language).
But consoles as a programming concept aren't. They've been around since forever. And any programmer worth his salt knows how to use them. Blame this lack of knowledge on the script kiddies who can wrangle a popup menu out of jQuery but know little else about programming.
 if (console.log) alert = function(foo) { console.log(foo); };
Your comment reveals a level of willful ignorance combined with a smug superiority that no reply could hope to influence, so I won't bother.
Downloading a javascript library is the quick part.
&gt; In the example, it creates an empty function. IE has its own console in the Developer tools though, so why not use that? IE8's developer tools understand `console.log`. But only when the devtools are open, and it doesn't understand the rest of the Firebug `console` API.
&gt; debug isn't any better than log, info, warn or error. Incorrect: `debug` does exactly the same thing as `log` except (in firebug) it also *adds a link to the JS source which generated it*. `info`, `warn` and `error` behave the same as `debug` but also add color and little image markers, so they're different beasts.
I am THE JS guy at my work. Friday someone actually asked me "What does that console.log do?" So, yes there are people out there that still don't know.
its not jquery though
you really should provide a better alternative to console.log when it isn't available; otherwise, when debugging in a browser that doesn't support console (say, IE) then the developer will end up reverting to alert so they can see what they were trying to log. For instance Ben Alman provides a decent console.log wrapper: http://benalman.com/projects/javascript-debug-console-log/ or maybe faux console: http://icant.co.uk/sandbox/fauxconsole/ if console.log isn't available in all development environments you need to test debug in then you won't be able to get everyone to adopt it as their default practice. 
BooTools
They are very different. Very very different.
Not every language on every platform offers them. As someone who has been doing Javascript since Netscape 2, I only recently discovered them (I've had my own equivalency library for it since about 1998). I can imagine if the first line of code you wrote was in 2010, you'd discover them on introduction to the language, but some of us have been at this game for well over a decade, many years prior to the integration. There's more to life then your own perspective of reality.
&gt; There will be (already is) a backlash by disgruntled C#/Java/Python &gt; /Ruby/PHP/Perl programmers who (perhaps unfairly) see the node.js &gt; community as a bunch of kids running around waving toy guns, whereas &gt; they fancy themselves battle-hardened war veterans. Ha well I'm glad I'm not alone. Yeah I think these articles/posts kind of just feed the "not impressed at all" fire. Node.js is a hard sell to a server-side developer that has been using any language which has been improved 24/7 for at least the last 10 years in addition to a vast amount of libraries and supporting tools. Whereas JavaScript, the language proper, seems to still be working out some kinks in the language(which in its defense is really hard to do given all the stakeholders and "leaders"). Plus node is brand new and is building things from scratch that have existed elsewhere for many years. Its all kind of ridiculous but I guess its natural. New languages come to server side and everybody builds everything over again. Its kind of depressing from a SE perspective though. Is this progress?
Well I'm excited. The key events look pretty cool. The once psuedo event is going to be really useful too. http://mootools.net/docs/more/Class/Events.Pseudos#Pseudos:once
&gt; However, the real cpower of the new Locale is its inheritance abilities. For example, if you take Portuguese, it’s used in several countries around the world, like in Brazil. Brazilian Portuguese is slightly different, but has many similarities. Now instead of recreating a whole Locale Set file, you can now inherit the Portuguese translations and overwrite only the values that are different. Hey, this is pretty smart.
jQuery -&gt; PHP MooTools -&gt; Python Closure -&gt; Java
Explain yourself.
Just to make things clear, I wrote my first line of code in about...1994. I've worked in Basic, Pascal, C, VB, PHP, Lingo (a rather esoteric one, I know), ActionScript and, more recently, C#. And JavaScript, of course. Considering that the 1.0 release of Firebug was made around January 2007, and it was in beta releases for a good 5 months or so before that, it means that we have had consoles for JavaScript since at least 4 years now. This kind of stuff should be in your Programming 101 book. I think I'll stop posting to reddit and go write a blog post about using debuggers in JavaScript. That should bring me some easy traffic.
What's the point of specifying a parameter for the function if it doesn't do anything? Why not just window.console = window.console || {log: function() {}, info: function() {}}; All of the javascript engines I'm aware of (and there may exist some where this is not true) will still run that function, even if the number of parameters passed doesn't match the signature.
Where's the code?
The OP keeps posting images an videos, but I have yet to see any code.
This has nothing to do with me.
not releasing it yet. it'd make a pretty underwhelming demo in the current state.
I decided to make this plugin after being frustrated with the complexity of jQuery UI tabs, and all of the styling it does out-of-the-box (which is great when you're getting started, but a PITA when you need your own custom styling). I would like any feedback anyone has. Also, here's a [live demo](http://www.alfajango.com/blog/jquery-easytabs-plugin/demo-multiple-on-same-page/). EDIT: If anyone has any feedback as to why this has been downvoted, I would love to hear it so I can make it better. A lot of people have found this plugin very helpful in their projects, and it's in use in a few large-scale projects, for the very same reasons I wrote it. Perhaps it's just not interesting to the reddit community?
Been doing this for a long time now. Love how easy it is to work with javascript in a windows .net application. It can be tricky the more complex it gets, especially with the minimal documentation on msdn for jscript.net, but if you know VBscript or C# it can be pretty easy to figure out how to get things working in jscript.net. I've done complex applications with threading and all sorts of I/O - robotics controllers, photo viewers that span multiple monitors (figures out the layout of the screens, etc), ffmpeg front-ends, and lots more. Tons of fun. Compiled Jscript.net runs fast too, faster than wscript/cscript for sure. 
The only question is, now that we have this tool, do we use it for good or _evil_?
Been there, [done that](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperoffice) (I worked on that team).
i think problem is more systematic. but if you have to use those variables then ['one', 'two', 'three'].forEach(function (val) { if(this[val+'Loaded'] === true){ isLoaded = true; } });
Holy crap! My brain explodes just thinking about this! How will I sleep now?
alert is very useful when you want to block script execution and display some piece of data. Occasionally that is necessary. It also works cross-browser, cross-platform. console.log is very useful in situations where it is available, but it isn't always available. 
If anyone's wondering about the technique behind this, here's the seminal paper: [Robust real-time object detection - Viola &amp; Jones]( http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/viola/Pubs/Detect/violaJones_IJCV.pdf)
They probably should. You can access unnamed `arguments`.
You'll sleep under the watchful gaze of your computer... Think about *that* next time you're fapping!
Sweet! Thanks!
The developer of the demo [had a post](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/dy81y/my_notsoslow_face_detector_in_javascript/) that got only ~50 upvotes. Please do him the favor of giving him more karma. I also asked him to allow links in the address bar. If you do a search you can then copy the address bar and link directly to your example. In terms of face detection, the algorithm is good, but it [still has troubles like any face detection algorithm](http://liuliu.me/detect/detect.html#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.danzfamily.com%2Farchives%2Fblogphotos%2F07%2Fhillary-clinton-faces-vertical.jpg). Hopefully someone can use this image (or one like it) to fix those problems.
As an example, in iOS there is a 10MB resource cap for CSS, JavaScripts and images. So yes, file size is an immediate concern.
My personal gripe with String.split is that you can't get "the remainder." For example, `"foo bar baz reddit rulez".split(" ",3)` gives `["foo","bar","baz"]`, while in most other languages, like Perl, it gives `["foo","bar","baz","reddit rulez"]`.
Works for [multiple faces in a pic also](http://liuliu.me/detect/detect.html#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tennisgrandstand.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2009%2F08%2Fagassi-graf.jpg)
You could always fix it to your liking: String.prototype.split = function(delim, n) { var parts = [] , remainder = this , m n = typeof n === 'undefined' ? -1 : n while (m = remainder.match(delim)) { parts.push(remainder.slice(0, m.index)) remainder = remainder.slice(m.index + m[0].length) if (n &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; parts.length &gt;= n) break } parts.push(remainder) return parts } 
*Obligatory post about how well the algorithm recognizes horses.*
Yeah but why does a simple hack deserve it's own acronym? An acronym that makes no sense on top of it.
This was a very well-written, unbiased blog post. I have had similar thoughts about NodeJS but most articles either way "ZOMG NODEJS ROCKS" or "JS SUCKS." I loved how he just sequentially listed facts like: &gt; NodeJS has built in support for doing DNS asynchronously, and it supports TLS (i.e. SSL). It also supports advanced HTTP features such as pipelining, chunked encoding, etc. &gt; NodeJS has a REPL. &gt; Dahl works for Joyent. I hope more people upload good overview articles like this instead of sparse/shallow Top 10 Reason Your Mom Should Switch To NodeJS. The fact that it isn't 12 page long is not a problem. A good overview can still include complex details without getting down to the nitty-gritties.
I'm using jquery backbonejs coffeescript Jamit and ruby on rails. I'm not really building a framework but I have been thinking of making something like the google maps API so you could embed levels on your own website.
JSONP JSON with Padding But yeah, I can't stand the acronym overload either.
I made a JS library that helps you with JSONP and hopefully removes any confusion about it. It has a lot of JSONP API's built in (including Reddit's API). Demo: http://meltingice.github.com/JSONP-Fu/ Code: https://github.com/meltingice/JSONP-Fu
Does "with Padding" have a meaning that I am unfamiliar with?
Agreed that it's a dumb acronym, but it needs to be distinguished from JSON somehow, doesn't it?
AJAX
And how often is XML used in an AJAX pattern? I think we should rename AJAX to AJAJ. Asynchronous Javascript and JSON
You could first use .split(';') and then go through each of those elements and use .split(',') Edit: typo
 var data = "a, b, c; d, e, f;"; // remove whitespace and the trailing ';'. data = data.replace(/\s*/g, "").replace(/;$/, ""); data = data.split(";"); var a = []; for(var i in data) { a.push(data[i].split(",")); }
What you described above would require an object of some sort, unless you meant: [0] =&gt; [0] =&gt; a [1] =&gt; b [2] =&gt; c [1] =&gt; [0] =&gt; d [1] =&gt; e [2] =&gt; f In which case: var csv = 'a,b,c;e,f,g;'; // remove the last ';' otherwise you'll get an extra empty index in the array var s = csv.substring(0, csv.length-1).split(';'); // s === ['a,b,c', 'd,e,f'] var s2; var split = []; for (var i = 0; i &lt; s.length; i++) { s2 = s[i].split(','); // s2 === ['a', 'b', 'c'] split[i] = s2; } // split === [['a','b','c'], ['d','e','f']] Note: split can use regex if you need it to be more robust
If not all data are single words, this is bugged, so I suggest changing the first regexp a bit: data = data.replace(/\s*([,;])\s*/, "$1").replace(/;$/, ""); Of course, this too will fail for a more complex CSV (with quotes protecting the commas and the semicolons)...
I don't understand the point of this. I import a big data structure just by giving the json a name, eg: A file named paralog.js contains: var varName = [ a lot of json ]; and my html/js file has a line: &lt;script src="paralog.js" &gt;&lt;/script&gt; That paralog file could just as well be in another domain. No parsing necessary. I just use the variable varName. It's my own file, so I don't worry about malicious content. Does something so simple and obvious deserve an acronym? 
At least you work with people who can use JSON. For me it would be more like AJAMPABORTSDM (AJA Me Parsing A Bunch Of Random Text Some Douchebag Made)
The JSON is padded w/ a function call, padding is bold in this JSONP response: **myCallback(**{"some":"data","more":"data"}**)** I don't care about the acronym one way or another. It needed a name and it has one.
RPC ;-)
If there file is in another domain, you cannot access it via ajax, you can however include via a script tag or use jsonp to fetch the content.
thanks, that's just what I need.
Yay! It's 1983, in my browser!!!11!!!1!
This is why I call it Ajax (not capitalized, not an acronym). :)
That totally works, but it's also synchronous and probably that file is static. Generally JSONP is fetched on demand from a web service. What you're doing is basically just an include.
moron alert? easy! alert(moron); THANK YOU! I'LL BE HERE ALL WEEK!
Oh, it has a name now? I did something similar more than 2 years ago. You can do this dynamically, instead of just using static html, this way: function invokeJSONP(url) { var s = document.createElement('script'); s.type = "text/javascript"; s.src = url; document.body.appendChild(s); // activate it } Once the script is loaded, it may be removed again as it no longer serves a purpose. 
Next step: Flying Windows!
Fortunately THIS version of Tetris can't destroy my life because SPACEBAR NO WORKIE.

Yay! It's 1983 in my browser!!!!1!!!!!!!!11!!!
I, uh, can't...control it? Chrome 7.0.517.41.
Totally -- I fixed this, looks like Chrome doesn't fire a onkeypress for arrow keys. Thanks for the comment.
Perhaps I am missing the boat, but why sandbox natives only to turn around and not have native access to functionality. What I mean by this is that by calling new sb.String('foo') you make your code look no different than turning around and using something like jQuery. The point of Prototype and MooTools, from my understanding, is that you don't work outside of the normal native types (for the most part). Rather you get more functionality already attached to it for more natural syntax. Personally, I feel if you want to sandbox extensions to native types you might as well go the jQuery route otherwise use MooTools or Prototype.
For reference, the proper way is to put all 7 pieces (once or twice - I think once is standard) into a list, then shuffle, use them up, and repeat. Doing that with a [ShuffleBag](http://kaioa.com/node/53) is very easy. It basically boils down to this: var sb=new ShuffleBag(), i; for(i=7;i--;)sb.add(i, 2); // or once and whenever you need one you just call `sb.next()`.
In the first example, Chrome is wrong. In the second example, all browsers are wrong. Here is why: The arguments object already exists (and the named-arguments already bound) at the time of the function invocation and primitives are non-mutable in JavaScript. Assigning a new primitive value to the arguments pseudo-array should change the value in its slot but it also means that the variable now references a different object. function doAdd(){ // Internally Javascript is doing something like: var args = [10, 25]; var num1 = args[0]; var num2 = args[1]; args[1] = 10; // Doesn't change num2... return (num1 + num2); // 35 } Why is JavaScript keeping the arguments pseudo-array linked to the named values even after assignment? That is different from the way primitives are handled in every other instance.
This doesn't really have much to do with JavaScript does it? Why don't you ask in those comments or try the mozilla forums?
Huh...I thought what I was doing was grabbing a random shape out of the shapes list every time a new Shape is created. I didn't notice it being weird when playing it in my browser. Can you explain a little more?
Although some javascript syntax may have been used, this is most definitely an issue with themes on firefox. Try australasia's approach.
No. I've had my own full blown debugger for 12 years. I was done. Is there something better then gdb out there? I don't know ... gdb does everything I want. If someone's needs are accommodated by something than I venture to say that there is small reason to go about looking elsewhere
Parsing a CSV is not the easiest thing to do when you have to account for quoted fields that may contain commas, newlines or escaped (doubled) quotes. A fully CSV-compliant version takes a page or two, with or without regex.
Any critiques or desired components are welcome.
You should submit this to /r/programming and /r/coding.
Thanks: http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/e2fyd/javascript_game_framework_not_engine/ Doesn't show up in /r/programming. Is that normal? Edit: Fuck it. It's JS related anyway.
I'm the provider of the CSV and I can be sure that it contains nothing but alphanumerics.
&gt; Named functions are typically much faster than anonymous functions Really? If this is true, it would surprise me. My guess is that it's not whether the function is named that matters, but whether it's already defined well before it's called, or whether it's being defined just when it's called. In other words, I would guess that these two snippets should have exactly the same performance: redis.get('key', function(err, reply) { do_something(reply); }); redis.get('key', function thisIsANamedFunction(err, reply) { do_something(reply); }); even though one has a named function and one has an anonymous function. Because in both cases, the JS engine has to first create the function and then call it. If we extract the function kind of the way that ripter recommended, then it *defines* the function well before it *calls* the function. So when it's calling the function, it goes much faster. Am I totally wrong?

Not specificly, but I do have the gadgets.rpc context and can pass messages to the container (so it seems). I'm testing my gadget on iGoogle.

I'll think about it some more. @rjett That's absolutely fine. Personally, I find the syntax cumbersome, and some of the idioms (inheritance, self-executing closures, var/global) irritating to use.

Pretty cool, makes me more motivated to finish one of my html5 games that I've started and just left lying around. =) The music is pretty fun as well, was it made by a friend?
I'm sure your suggestion is great and all, but I would go with Firebug.
It was made by 4mat, as the caption says :) Thanks for playing!
This is awesome! Why do all the good reddits come in when I'm working?
Loved it, thanks for submitting this.
Really good.Bring me back some memories.
100% addicted to Tetris!
I love it.
Thank you everyone for your kind comments! I would like to also draw your attention to the fact that this game is open source, the source is publicly available at [bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/ido.yehieli/cardinal-quest/) and we are very liberal about giving potential contributors commit access ;)
Here's a memory of my first day at kindergarten. I was confused, didn't know what this weird place was or why I was there. The teacher wanted us to cut and paste something, I remember cutting a circle or something. My scissors were awkward - maybe because I was left handed. I eventually adapted to cutting right handed as well as left handed. My art was nothing like I had wanted it, but the teacher said it looked good. I knew they had no idea what in the hell I drew. My mom put it on the fridge and I still have it in my baby box. It's a miracle I survived childhood.
Pretty damn cool. Surprisingly addicting considering how simple it is. I especially like the way you guys handled vision. Sadly, I clicked a link by accident and lost my progress. Very nice concept, well executed.
fuck you i'm tryin to get some work done here
Would it hurt to put a blinking cursor on the front screen so you know it's ok to type. I was clicking around the page for a full minute and refreshed it once to try and find where to type my name in. Then I figured you just need to start typing. :-\
Damn I must be old; I just knew I was meant to type my name in. Looked like an 8-bit game, had text input like an 8-bit game. Blinking cursors? Get offa ma lawn you darned kids...
Well it doesn't need to even be blinking, a single | will tell you that's where it will start typing.
*Notes*
Thank you!
That was enjoyable. Lovin' me my dungeon crawlers.
Ah, and here I thought maybe it had a bad dependency on google-analytics or something.
Cool! Kinda reminds me of an updated version of [Nethack](http://www.nethack.org/). (there I go, dating myself, again!)
Greets! :) Just a note from OpenGameArt.org: We have some sprites that you might find handy: * http://opengameart.org/content/twelve-16x18-rpg-character-sprites-including-npcs-and-elementals * http://opengameart.org/content/twelve-more-16x18-rpg-character-sprites * http://opengameart.org/content/twelve-more-characters-3-free-characters-and-a-child-template * http://opengameart.org/content/halloween-gift-for-oga * http://opengameart.org/content/rat-and-rat-king-overworld-antifarea-style Awesome project, by the way. I'll keep an eye on it. :) 
Kept trying to type commands from rogue. E for equip, q for quaff.
Thanks! Sadly these aren't really compatible with the style of the current sprites.
this is fantastic. now put it in a bookmarklet (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) for offline work: http://www.iphonehacks.com/2008/02/iphoneiwebsaver.html
TLDR // Numerical Ascending var a = [30,2,1,9,15]; a.sort( function(a, b) { return a - b; }); // Alphabetically Ascending var b = [earth,mars,venus,pluto]; b.sort( function(a, b) { if (a &lt; b) return -1; if (a &gt; b) return 1; return 0; }); 
I've been working on something similar for a while now. I've focused on only supplying display-related components, leaving aside any game-specific ones. I really like the whole style of doing things with entities (or ents as i call them), but remain unsold on the concept of components. Then again, I've been focused mostly on API syntax and runtime speed over capabilities. I also just ported my engine (yea, I call it an engine) to canvas (from CSS positioning), so I've got a little work to do re-implementing some of the old features. I'll post a link if you're interested and I would love to see the code you've been working on.
Not fair. It may be beneath you, but still useful for someone else. Also you missed the more interesting sorting by distance, a multi-parameter comparison/sorting.
I'd love to have a look at that. Mine is on github at the moment. https://github.com/louisstow/Crafty Nothing too flashy at the moment. Mainly working on the core components such as collision and drawing (canvas or DOM).
It looks awful.
They give you a solution right away, so what's the goal? To do it using less characters than the reference solution? To do it in a cleverer way than the reference solution? To give a more efficient solution?
It seems the goal is efficiency.
Here's my results: http://tinyurl.com/23jtye9 (347% faster than short clean code) I don't see much point in optimising this function for n=100, if the challenge was to optimise for n=10e6 or something similar then I might try a little harder. function mySolution(n) { var res = []; var i=1; var sum = 0; var t; for (var i=1; i &lt;= n; i++) { if (t=i%10) { sum++; if (t==7) continue; } else { if (t=i%100) { if (t==70) { sum++; i+=9; continue; } sum-=8; // +1-9 } else { // recalcuate sum only 1% of the time, // nest deeper if want to optimise for large n sum = 0; t = i; while (t &gt; 0) sum += t % 10, t = t/10&gt;&gt;0; if ((t=(i+'').indexOf('7'))&gt;=0) { i+=Math.pow(10,(i+'').length-t-1)-1; // skip large ranges (eg. 700-799) continue; } } } // avoid costly string operation: for (t=1; t&lt;=sum &amp;&amp; ((sum%(t*10))/t)&gt;&gt;0==7; t*=10); if (i%7 &amp;&amp; sum%7 &amp;&amp; t&gt;sum) res[res.length] = i; } return res; };
If you copy paste the clean code version and test it, it'll be half as fast as the clean code version it's tested against =P
Heh github rules, you can find my work at [https://github.com/vonkow/Rosewood](https://github.com/vonkow/Rosewood) Right now, I've only ported two of the original examples to the new canvas version, but it should be enough to get an idea. The bouncy ball example just shows off triangular, circular and rectangular collisions, whereas the Evil Eye example is a playable (and somewhat addictive) game. I should be working on the conversion more over the next few weeks, hopefully restoring all the functionality the DOM version had, while fixing a bunch of bugs. Feel free to look through the engine code, but be warned, there's a lot of crap in it a the moment and the collision detection functions are ugly as hell (but fast). **Edit**: Figured I should mention that it's predominately a sprite-based engine at the moment. But I'll be adding support for canvas drawing soon.
Very cool. Changing the depth from 3 to 5 crashes my Firefox4 ... then again ... many things crash my Firefox4.
very very impressive!
Mine now doesn't run in hardware accelerated mode any more. =( The previous Beta did!
What's a good browser to use - as FF 4 beta is not working for it on my machine.
Chromium/Chrome 8/9 Firefox4 -- works but slowly. For me of course -- as I understand it crashes for others. Safari should work too. There is no way to test it on linux.
Have crash ids? http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Mozilla+Crash+Reporter
Make sure your video drivers are fully up to date. Sadly most Intel drivers were disabled as they had major issues.
Works fine on Linux w/ Firefox 4 and Nvidia drivers.
Any other interesting matrix combinations? Played with the numbers some and got [this](http://petraszd-static.appspot.com/ifs3d/ifs.html#0.5,0,0,0,0,0.5,0,0.5,0,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,1,0.5,0,0,0.5,0,0.5,0,-0.5,0,0,0.5,-0.5,0,0,0,1,0.3,0,0,0.3,0,0.3,0,-0.3,0,0,0.3,0.3,0,0,0,1,0.5,0,0,-0.5,0,0.5,0,-0.5,0,0,0.5,-0.5,0,0,0,1,0.5,0,0,-0.5,0,0.5,0,-0.5,0,0,0.5,0.5,0,0,0,1)
Hey that looks nice. One thing I would recommend is writing some Unit tests. That makes it easier to refactor and ensure nothing breaks. I could see a few lines that I could make more efficient but I don't want to break anything haha. Rosewood looks more of an engine as it doesn't need anything to start making a game. I'm making mine more of a framework so devs can use jQuery or some other library. I don't have the patience to work with cross-browser issues in the DOM.
Thanks.
I see, thanks. It's a GeForece 6800 GT... really old underpowered card, but I should see a little improvement with it.
check in [Firefox's AMO.](https://addons.mozilla.org/) As far as I recall, there were a few add-ons that did something like that. Most of them are open source. Once you find the right one, open it and use its source code (Javascript).
Have you had a look at [jslint](http://www.jslint.com/lint.html)? It's a MIT licensed Pratt Parser.
Looks like the current nvidia drivers still support the 6800. Grab the latest drivers from [http://nvidia.com](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) if you are using Windows.

Just found /r/jquery - although it seems a bit quiet. Have cross-posted this in there.
I highly advise you look into [SlickGrid](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid). It's heavy-duty and has incremental rendering so it stays performant. I also advise you check the [examples](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/wiki/Examples) which illustrate that it has some outstanding spreadsheet-like functionality. 
you might try [this](http://tablesorter.com/docs/) as well, not sure if can do the CRUD, but I think everything else, and you might be able to extend hooks to allow you ajax interaction.
Thanks, I'll give that a try now.
No Fixed Header though.
This is beyond my wildest hopes and dreams.
This is indeed very interesting.
yeah, I couldn't remember if that was an option or not. you could [repeat headers](http://tablesorter.com/docs/example-widgets.html), or use the pager plugin. I'll see if I have any other table grid plugins laying around...
maybe one of [these](http://www.webdesignbooth.com/15-great-jquery-plugins-for-better-table-manipulation/) would fit the bill?
For what its worth, I've been using DataTables and have no issues with multiple tables in multiple jQuery UI tabs with differing sets of data.
http://zaach.github.com/jison/docs/ Jison
Hmm, I've been having the header's disappear, which would only come back when I redrew the tables. I don't want to keep redrawing about 5-6 tables though.
Check out http://codemirror.net/ and http://www.ymacs.org/demo/. 
Give [jqgrid](http://www.trirand.com/blog/) a gander. Has many customizable options.
I don't use headers, as I believe the tabs themselves serve that purpose quite well.
I've used this and it's pretty sweet. There is a lot of customization available, and it's documented pretty well if I remember correctly.
I've used DataTables a bunch, and they are extremely customizable. I believe you can override the callbacks for almost everything and you can use the api directly. So basically you can write any sort of "data in tables" application quite simply.
Slides didn't have much detail but now I'm interested enough to try and track that guy down and see if has audio from the talk. Thanks for the post.

Please see my update. C to JS converters exist, I just don't know of one that's written in JS.
Please see my update. C to JS converters exist, I just don't know of one that's written in JS.
If there is a C to JS converter, written in C, why not run the converter on the converter?
they are posting all the videos from the conf. just hold tight for a few days
In theory, you have all the pieces you need already. Step 1: Grab a C-to-JS compiler's source files, written in C, like clue or emscripten Step 2: Compile compiler to native code Step 3: Compile compiler to JS, using native code compiler Disclaimers: Compilers may choke on themselves. Final runtime speed may not dazzle. 
Weird? There's a lot of C code out there. If it could be compiled to JS imagine the JS libs we'd have at our disposal. The biggest hurdles will be: * performance, performant C code will be awful in JS due to differences in numeric types available (JS only has IEEE754 "doubles") * I/O, unless targeting something like Node or Rhino it's going to be difficult to translate functions that perform any I/O, good luck doing so in the browser (even for network requests you have to somehow translate them into JSON-P calls or similar, not trivial). However a C-to-Node compiler would be pretty badass if someone pulled it off.
Most compilers are capable of compiling themselves as it's a fantastic unit test. However, there are probably some significant restrictions on the C code these guys can compile into JavaScript which may prevent them from being self-hoisting... it's worth a shot, though. 
Exerrent. 
That's an interesting idea. I was lazily hoping there might be something out there that's already working, and I suppose I was hoping for something human-written in the hopes that it would be more human-readable. But in lieu of that, this is probably a good lead.
If you are willing to jailbreak your iOS device, you can install gcc and write, compile, sign and execute C code.
A lexer is not so hard to code if you can use regular expressions. And Javascript has regexes. Anyway, I remember a project of parser in Javascript called a [Packrat Parser](http://www.google.be/search?q=packrat+parser+javascript). You could check that out.
I was there - it was an interesting talk but the title is really misleading (Ross admitted this at the end of the talk). There's a few interesting takeaways: 1. Their scripts were very complex (check out the combo handled URLs!) and there was around a 2 second delay or so, when the user could start interacting with the page. Because of the way the pages are progressively enhanced for a fallback with JavaScript disabled, clicking on a link in this time might've meant a new page loaded (instead of a JavaScript popup). Because of this they actually implemented a mini-library at the top of the page that suppressed these clicks and showed a loading box instead, so at least the user knows something is happening. 2. Some of their combo handled URLs were way too big (2,700 characters). Some firewalls, in some attempt to prevent flooding attacks (?) restrict the number and cut off the URL after a certain point, resulting in some scripts not being downloaded. The solution was to minify the combo handled URL by finding the most common occurrences of words and replacing them with a minified version. 3. They found that filenames with "xxx" in them were blocked by filters (people at work, etc.), so they made sure to check that the URLs minified by #2 didn't contain "xxx". This is the first occurrence they found, but someone in the audience mentioned that they've seen the same problem with other words ("porn", "sex", etc.)
A C interpreter written in Javascript sounds like a class project. A somewhat complex one. But unless you write a VM, it will not be capable of running anything but the simplest subset of C. No pointer arithmetic, for instance.
Why don't you see if Clue can compile itself into Javascript? I wouldn't be surprised if it can't, but that's probably your best shot.
I think you'd have better success (and save time and resources) by ditching your crappy locked-down phone, and getting one that doesn't restrict your freedoms. If you have a C-to-JS translator, and it's written in C, then translate the C-to-JS translator into JS using the C-to-JS translator.
Yeah, you'd either have to create a C stdlib shim in JS or translate/compile stdlib functions to their JS equivalent.
The way all those projects run C code in a JS VM is by allocating a big memory array or two (some split "heap" and "stack", others just say fuck it and do it live in one big "ram" array.) Performance is pretty much as ghastly as you'd think, as js variables can pretty much only be used as registers. Adobe actually added special opcodes to their flash player to make this very use case suck less in their C-&gt;SWF compiler named [Alchemy](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/alchemy/).
We use dojo at work (not my decision, just joined the team a few weeks ago). We have a big mobile project coming up and i am going to try and squeeze some jquery in :) Dojo has some mobile stuff coming out, but it seems jquery is stealing all of the hearts these days
YO DAWG
I believe, though it's just a thought, that the application cannot *download* code to run on the machine, though it can include an interpreter (compiler, whatever) to run code that is included with the application... I think typing code in may fall through the cracks here and be allowed. Just a thought...
It's not a true MIT license because of one extra and extraordinarily ambiguous condition by Douglas Crockford. If you use his code, you cannot host your project on Google Code, they will kick you off. A great program spoiled by the will of a troll, ugh.
It's not a true MIT license, more like a troll license.
I want to know why [this](http://spin.atomicobject.com/2010/10/08/jquery-ajax-memory-leak-in-ie8) wasn't fixed in 1.4.4... It was moved to 1.4.5 for whatever unnecessary reason. Can anyone confirm the bug is still in 1.4.4?
Probably with some hacking with http://code.google.com/p/v8/ and http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/ you could develop something like that. Good luck man, It doesn't sound easy.
I was waiting for this release before I started learning jQuery. Thanks for the notification! Does anybody have any tutorial/documentation/books suggestions for a beginner with JavaScript experience?
It's not a brainteaser, the solution is obvious. The fun part is coming up with a solution that's more efficient, fewer lines of code, fewer functions.
Write your own using this: http://jscc.jmksf.com/
I can highly recommend Rebecca Murphey's [jQuery Fundamentals](http://jqfundamentals.com/book/book.html).
"The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil" after the official clause might be a problem for Debian and Google Code, but not for the rest of the world. :-). 
Thats pretty wrong actually, is this because hes working for Yahoo, and spreading that huge monostrosity that is YUI ?
I'm sure jeresig will be more than happy to apply your patch if you send him the fix.
woah, 1.4.3 was release like less than a month ago, they are really putting me to work!
Just dive in! ? Its unlikely they are gonna change the API too much; and most can be picked up pretty quickly.. You could also use versioning on your dev/prod server as well... 
Urgghh, Always IE leaking memory..... 
To ask a presumably stupid question, why do you want to be writing C code? Why not just write Javascript code directly and avoid all this futzing around.
[This book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/jQuery-Novice-Ninja-Earle-Castledine/dp/0980576857/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1289561211&amp;sr=8-1) is pretty good.
you don't really need to upgrade unless you're suffering from the bugs listed
Sounds like fun.

The decline of Ajaxian is a direct result of (former) Ajaxian author Dion Almaer's embracing of Twitter to post links about JS. I was a twitter skeptic until I realized that just about *all* of my JS heroes use twitter to post interesting links. Follow @dalmaer on twitter, and you'll have all of the JS news that you could ever want. 
The good parts is a VERY nice books. I would pick it up as a very nice intro to javascript. It has all those small things that makes you go "aaah, nice".

I agree. Javascript, the language, is quite small and easy to learn (if you've got already some languages under your belt) and this book will give a good and intensive introduction. The power of javascript, however, comes from the context it lives in (html,css,htmldom;svg,css,svgdom;...). Learning javascript in its context (whatever context) probably is more difficult as you do not only need to understand the language but also the context and how it is hooked into the context.
I really enjoyed this.
If those existing compilers are written in C, could you compile them to JS?
You're referring to [#6242](http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6242). The straight-up answer is that I just missed it, sorry. At the time we were putting together the fixes for 1.4.3 there were about 1500 tickets in the bug tracker and it was easy to miss the ponies in that pile. About a month ago we upgraded our bug tracker and have a greatly expanded the team of people going through the tickets to weed out the junk. There have been several tickets like #6242 that could have been put into 1.4.3/1.4.4 if they had been "found" earlier, but by the time they were found we were only dealing with regressions. Here's how you can help us. Don't "report" bugs by simply mentioning them in Reddit, Twitter, a blog post, or Stackoverflow. We can't scan the Internet to find them. Instead, read the [How to Report Bugs](http://docs.jquery.com/How_to_Report_Bugs) page and go from there. Please do be conservative in deciding when to create a ticket; the largest amount of work we have in bug triage is dealing with invalid tickets. With the updated bug tracker, you can now *vote* on tickets if you create a Trac account -- the voting links will be at the top of the page after you log in. We will be taking votes into account when deciding which tickets get attention. The best way to get a bug fixed is to pull down the jQuery Github repo, then craft both a patch and *test cases*. There are little code snippets in #6242 and some anecdotal reports that it fixes the problem (along with some that it doesn't). If we have test cases to prove it was fixed (and caused no regressions) that would move the process along. 
+1 on "JavaScript: The Good Parts" by Douglas Crockford! I didn't really like JS till I read this book and was set straight by Crockford. He spells it all out and tells you what to use and what not to. Before this book, I was always asking myself if I should embrace the OO or the prototypical and I disliked having both mechanisms available. Probably shouldn't be your first book but definitely read it once you have been doing JS for a couple of months.. 
All of Crockford's videos on the YUI Theatre website.
You'll need some server-side help with this, as XHR is required to always follow redirects. See the discussion here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/228225/prevent-redirection-of-xmlhttprequest
Just a tip, i'd also learn something like jQuery/dojo/etc. It'll make your life much much easier :) I learned them both at the same time, and daily I'd sweat over chapters in the javascript book "here is how you do the same thing, in each major browser!" and my Dojo book was like "doing this thing sucks in javascript because of different browsers. Here's you do it in Dojo one way that works on all browsers" Just my .02
can't XMLHttpRequest(); help us? 
Ah okay, and as far as I know the bug report was in there when that blog post was made (I didn't make it, I just saw it a month or so ago and was concerned about it).
The patch is easy to apply yourself, I was mainly just worried that it wasn't fixed in the most recent release since I only use the google API and/or jQuery hosted version.
thechangelog.com
I got it recently and laughed when I saw how small it is compared to most programming language books.
Great site! Thanks for the heads up.
Pick up the JavaScript Cookbook first, then get the good parts. While you go through the cookbook, create your own mini library in a singleton with all the snippets you've picked up. After that, go read the good parts and think about the mess you've just made.
+1 for thechangelog. Really good podcast.
Peter Cooper (the guy who does RubyInside, RailsInside, RubyFlow, Ruby Weekly, and Coder.io) has just (this week) launched a new weekly JavaScript newsletter called [JavaScript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/).
&gt;as XHR is required to always follow redirects.
sometimes more is less you know.
The problem is that while it goes into Javascript in depth it doesn't talk about actual web development. A good thing would be to get Js the good parts along with Pro javascript techniques or javascript: The Definitive Guide.
javascript is not an easy language by any stretch of the imagination. i've been doing js for years and its intricacies still astound me. it is an extremely deep language. look up variable hoisting, wtfjs.com. if you still think js is easy, look up the infamous javascript loop problem.
Don't know why you were downvoted, ie memory leaks are the bane of my existence and no i can't just drop support for ie.

I've read the pre-released pre-order version of "Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja" by John Resig (Founder of jQuery) and even in its early stages I've already learned a good bit and some nice trickes. http://jsninja.com/
For some reason people often answer "The Good Parts" as a recommendation for learning JavaScript. It seems to be a result of the unfortunate echo chamber in the JS community, where some people just mindlessly repeat whatever Douglas Crockford (or John Resig, etc etc) says. I disagree with this...."The Good Parts" is a book every JS'er should read, no doubt...but it should be the SECOND book you read. The Good Parts will give you a very good understanding of theory, but little practical knowledge. It covers very little DOM, browser issues, etc etc. I think a beginner will find it very boring and frustrating, as you're not gonna get much out of it. You'll learn all the constructs of JS, but without knowledge of how those things are applied in practice...I don't think it will stick in your mind. As a newbie reading The Good Parts, you're just trying to understand and remember everything... It's like trying to learn how to skateboard by understanding the entire "theory" of skateboarding... You don't do that. You learn a tiny bit of theory of a trick (x trick is where you jump and flip the board with your foot). You try the trick...then you learn more theory. Trying the trick helps you learn the theory, because it teaches you what to pay attention to. If your foot keeps catching on the board, you know when you are learning the theory to pay particular attention to what your foot is supposed to be doing. If you ask most great programmers how they started programming, they didn't enroll in a Com Sci class...they start by hacking out little games and practical stuff...the theory came later. Reading "The Good Parts" *after* some practical experience is like a revelation. It's not boring anymore because the entire time you're realizing how this stuff applies to what you have done...it helps you realize your mistakes.....this way it will stick in your mind much better. When Crockford wrote "The Good Parts" there weren't many good books on JS. That was 2 years ago, an eternity in Internet time, and this is no longer the case. I recommend the following course: - Professional JavaScript For Web Developers - Nicholas C Zakas This is a great book to start with. If you read this book carefully and understand it, you will be ahead of many JS'ers that I have met. It covers everything, including OOP in JS which is something a lot of newbies seem to struggle with. It also contains a considerable amount of theory and technical information. - The Good Parts This is a great read, and if you already know some JS, this will help you really "get" what JS is all about. - High Performance Javascript - Nicholas Zakas This book is more technical, and helps you understand the performance implications of your code. Even if you don't write speed critical code, this book will help you understand some of the JS internals and some advanced techniques a bit more. If you follow this course, I guarantee you will become a "ninja". Learn vanilla JS first, and once you are comfortable with it, pick up a library. There's also a lot of great resources on the Internet, but be wary...there's tons of horrible blog posts by php programmers that will just confuse you. For reference purposes, check Mozilla Developer Network first. Check out YUI Theatre, and the JSConf videos. Read the blogs of the greats John Resig, Crockford, Zakas, etc etc... Also, there's a lot of great JS communities on the web and irc to help you. Good Luck.
"Pro JavaScript Techniques" is really good especially if want to use jQuery (which I would recommend.) It is basically a break down of how a library like jQuery is written with a lot of other great information along the way.
Do not get "Javascript: The Definitive Guide". It's nothing but an exhaustive documentation of every object and method provided by the core Javascript language with very little context to understand it. You can Google that stuff. The Good Parts is the best place to start. Then get "Pro JavaScript Design Patterns", which has some good ideas for structuring your programs. Then get Resig's "Secrets of the Javascript Ninja" ebook to get to the next level shit.
So with just JS it's not possible at all!
I think the most fucked up part of js is it's scoping. I still can't quite understand why this would ever be needed in a modern language: function () { var self = this; } Yet I see that all over the place in jQuery's codebase.
It's called the internet
Jquery a million times
The link on their page to the speed test shows that they are one of the slower ones, and that jqote2 is the fastest.
i should also mention that the game isn't finished, for example if you get 'killed' by the snakes nothing will happen except you'll lose red hearts.
monster noise scared the crap out of me !! very cool game A*
Nice work. I thought the rain cloud was some evil lightning blimp. But a rain cloud's scary too.
The biggest problem with your code are [unnamed numerical constants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_%28programming%29#Unnamed_numerical_constants). Right now the code still makes sense to you, but things will look differently in a few weeks. The next big problem is formatting. if (L[i][6]!=1) {ctx.fillText( L[i][5], L[i][1], L[i][2]);}} Looks bad at first glance, but looks even worse if you take a second look. That second closing curly came from somewhere else. That updateFloor function which ends with "}}}}" is also amazingly awful. Code is at least 5 times more read than written. Sloppy formatting will *always* waste time.
okay, is the 'amazingly awful' bracket group bad aesthetically or is there something I can do to fix it ? I would appreciate it if you could point me in some direction.. as I said I am completely new to programming... I'm basically teaching myself via internet tutorials and by looking at other codes.
It should be formatted like this: function updateFloor () { var x, y, cc; floorList = []; for (x = 0; x &lt; 640; x += 10) { for (y = 0; y &lt; 480; y += 14) { if (placefree(x + 4, y + 8) == 0) { cc = refList[Math.floor(x / 5) + Math.floor(y / 5)]; floorList.push([x, y, cc]); } } } } I also put all variable declarations at the top of their scope. Well, I highly recommend Crockford's book "JavaScript: The Good Parts" and of course also all of his talks. There are many available over at the [YUI Theater](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/). But for starters... get [Komodo Edit](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit/downloads), put your JS into a separate file, and use the [kjslint](http://community.activestate.com/xpi/kjslint-jslint-komodo) addon frequently (I'm using a before-save trigger for example). The options for JSLint are explained on its [website](http://jslint.com/). You can inline those options in your JavaScript files through special comments. There is `/*jslint ...*/` and `/*global ...*/` (note that there is no space in front of either keyword.) E.g. if you use `/*jslint plusplus:false*/` the ++ and -- check is disabled and you can write stuff like x++ again. Komodo will make writing properly formatted JS a lot easier and JSLint will help you to improve the quality of your code by pointing out constructs which are either a mistake or look like a mistake (since these will waste your time whenever you read your code you should replace them with something clearer). If you watched all of Crockford's talks and still want to watch some more, you should take a look at Nicholas C. Zakas' talks. I learned a lot from him and I also really liked his book "High Performance JavaScript".
wow, thankyou very much.
&gt; It should be formatted like this:... Code formatting is extremely subjective thing. When you say how something should be, it's just personal preference. In fact I format my personal projects like this... function updateFloor () { var x, y, cc; floorList = []; for (x = 0; x &lt; 640; x += 10) { for (y = 0; y &lt; 480; y += 14) { if (placefree(x + 4, y + 8) == 0) { cc = refList[Math.floor(x / 5) + Math.floor(y / 5)]; floorList.push([x, y, cc]); } } } } ...in a very pythonesque manner. What you call amazingly awful is completely inconsequent to my eye. Of course if you work in a team, you should be consistent and use whatever format they have chosen.
It's actually a pretty cool looking game. Though I had a couple of game play issues: - Took me a while to figure out the controls - The controls feel a bit laggy - I had a hard time seeing the enemies As far as coding goes, I think your biggest problem is readability. I had a hard time understanding how your code worked. For example you have a list called `L` (IMO a bad variable name) which holds all the game objects. As is turns out every game object is also an array, which means `L` is actually an array of arrays. This is very confusing. It's great that you document (line 237) what each index in a game object/array referred to (e.g. `L[i][0]`is the type, `L[i][1]` is the x position, etc...), but there's a better way. I recommend that you start using [object literals](http://www.dyn-web.com/tutorials/obj_lit.php). Here's how you could use object literals to initialize the `L` array: for(var i &lt; 0; i &lt; L.length; i++) { // TODO: Use better initial values L[i] = { type: 0 , x: 0 , y: 0 , xspeed: 0 , yspeed: 0 , special: "" , age: 0 }; } Once you make `L` an array of object literals, you can start referring to an game object's attribute by using this syntax: L[i].type // returns the game object's type L[i].x // return the game object's x position This is much more readable. Of course this is just the tip of the iceberg, but I think it's a nice first step. Hope this helps.
&gt;Code formatting is extremely subjective thing. Not really. There are a few popular indent styles and out of those popular ones only one (1TBS) works with JavaScript. As a result, virtually everyone uses it. I'd say more than 95% of the people who have actually learned JavaScript use 1TBS. Using a different indent style is just a waste of everyone's time. That "pythonesque" indent style is extremely unpopular and there are a couple of completely unnecessary downsides to it.
because every function in javascript is a closure?
It certainly isn't waste of my own time if I can be more productive with it, assuming no one else is to mess with it (other than python programmers :p). The only downside I can see is losing track of the brackets in more extreme cases, but so far I haven't had single bracket related incident. I'm still interested in hearing more of the downsides I may be overlooking. main upsides (these really are very subjective) -I can see/read codeblocks much easier without the trailing clutter -I can fit more code on the screen (more compact) these lead to -faster to shift through large chunks of code and find the right places -can keep multiple small windows open and still see enough code to work efficiently lastly -it just looks really damn good. Pythoners agree. Unpopularity doesn't make it wrong. 
Will do, thanks.
Ooooh I like it!
less than or equal to. you have equal to or less than
That was it. Thank you so much!
Just out of curiosity, what do you do that you come across so many? And are there more in jQuery that I should be aware of?
awesome suggestions...thanks :)
&gt; "I only just started learning programming like a month ago." Now *that's* an impressive learning curve!
&gt;I'm still interested in hearing more of the downsides I may be overlooking. Auto indention and auto un-indention won't work. You also have to keep track of the indention level yourself and count the number of closing curlies. Moving lines around inside one code block is asymmetric, because the last line is a special case. Also, nested do-while loops will look hideous. &gt;trailing clutter Except it isn't. The closing curlies mark the end of blocks. It's critical to get them right. &gt;Unpopularity doesn't make it wrong. You have to work with other people's code and other people have to work with your code.
It helps very much, thankyou. I had no idea you could do that.
Cool! I love the ASCII effect. =) Also, you've got the jump just nice.
Skeww sounds really harsh, but they've got a good point with the code layout. ...unless you weren't going to share the code, then most of it is moot.
Learn Whitesmith indent style! It's seriously OldSkool and not used nowhere near enough for my liking. Also, use a blue background. N00bies will see your development desktop and automatically see a leet oldskooler. =D
In Opera 10.63 Build 3516, when I move my mouse over the canvas the game stops. &gt; JavaScript - http://loadsofcodes.blogspot.com/ &gt; &gt;Uncaught exception: [object DOMException] &gt;Error thrown at line 327, column 2 in drawAll(): &gt; ctx.arc(mx,my,20,0,Math.PI*2,1); &gt;called from line 37, column 10 in mLoop(): &gt; drawAll();
I started with Whitesmiths and a blue background (TurboC 1.0 "IDE" - it also lacked mouse support, by the way). I don't really miss those days.
I am working on formatting it and making the names clearer and relevant. I noticed that some people make their codes purposely obscure and difficult to read, trust me, in this case it is just amateurishness.
Oh, sorry. I didn't know it would do that. I think "evt.LayerX" only works for Chrome, FF and Safari. I'll try to fix that sometime.
It may just be 10.xx, someone with 11 should test it.
Boy, it took me bloody ages to finish that article, but I'm sorta happy with the result. Hope it's of some use. **Edit:** That [`simpleLoader`](http://kaioa.com/b/1011/simpleLoader.js) thingy might be interesting for beginners. It's an easy way to load images at start up. (function () { var setup, render; setup = function () { MBTIC.simpleLoader({ foo: 'foo.jpg', // add as name/path pairs bar: 'bar.png' }, function (images) { render(images); }); }; render = function (images) { var ctx = document.getElementById('canvas').getContext('2d'); ctx.drawImage(images.foo, 0, 0); //access via name ctx.drawImage(images.bar, 64, 0); }; window.onload = setup; }());
A lot of articles on Javascript preach OO and talk about how javascript doesn't do it, or doesn't do it right. I feel like its mostly because people don't understand how to use the inheritance model. Personally, I think the standard prototypical inheritance in javascript works fine for almost all cases. What's lacking is some easy way to call super. There's a hundred different documented ways of doing that though, and almost all of them don't require you to tie yourself to a framework.
Reloading a page in ie where you don't null out your private variables and especially circular references. If you don't do this correctly every time you refresh the memory will slowly increase. This is less jquery and more your code structure.
Brill! Thank you very much for finding the time to share this!
I just put my web dev hat on a few weeks ago, after 5 or so years of back end work. I read through a javascript book, css book, jsp/servlet book, and then cracked open two dojo books. Dojo makes it very easy to do cross browser javascript stuff. I would highly recommend looking into it. It does seem like you hear about jquery 20x a day on the web though (dojo about once per week)
That's because the dojo online documentation is fucking atrocious and I'd rather use something slightly crufty like jquery rather than figure out how to properly use dojo
"jQuery in particular is aimed more at people that don't necessarily 'know' javascript" That's a fallacious statement. jQuery is how good javascript is written, embracing a simple and functional style. I recommend jQuery over other frameworks because it really encourages a functional style.
You think it's the best framework, but you have never even worked with the others. Think about this: "I think my Toyota Camery is the best car compared to Ferrari or Porsche but I have never driven them."
I say that because I have looked into the others, and personally, I just didn't get jQuery's structure. I didn't make this post to bash any other frameworks, but to ask those that swear by them what makes them prefer it.
jQuery. Much better documentation, larger community, more plugins.
I prefer jQuery because I don't know Mootools
Excellent reasoning.
Well, that's pretty much what OP said about Mootools.
It's been a while since I used Moo tools, so I don't remember a lot about it, but it was the first JS framework I ever used. I moved to jQuery fairly quickly and much prefer it. I wouldn't at all say jQuery is for "people who don't know javascript." I'd say jQuery has a much faster learning curve and therefore may be easier for people who aren't JS experts to pick up on and do some basic things, like simple animations/transitions/basic AJAX, etc. but jQuery is a very powerful library that encourages clean, functional code. The biggest problem I see with noob jQuery code is a fundamental misunderstanding of how the jQuery object itself works. Many people who just use jQuery for those simple things like making a DIV fade out or zebra striping a table, without bothering to actually learn more JS fundamentals tend to under-estimate it, or wrap every object in $() when it's not called for, which just slows things down and creates a mess, e.g. you'll see a lot of crap like url = $(elem).attr('href')....
jQuery is slanted towards people who like functional languages - like Javascript's core (To be completely honest, javascript's core in an interesting blend of functional and object oriented prototypical inheritance style). MooTools, less so. That being said, I've used both and enjoyed both, I think that it's more of a style choice than anything else.
http://jqueryvsmootools.com/
And if you ever do any .Net work, the library is setup for Visual Studio's intellisense.
I prefer jQuery because I tend to do more progressive enhancements and the way jQuery traverses the DOM, chaining of functions and adding of events just makes that quicker to do. I also prefer coding in a more functional manner which jQuery encourages.
Here's my lesson from the trenches: if you're not careful, dojo gets really slow really fast.
I forgot about this! Thanks for bringing it back up, after re-reading it, I'm sure that Mootools is the framework I want to stick to, buuuut, it would be wise to learn how to work with jQuery since some clients and employers may prefer it. :/
The effect was excellent, until it crashed my machine HARD. (Dell XPS M1530 laptop 4gb running Win7-64 running Chrome 9.0.576.0 beta) Which leads me to a request: Can I use your code as part of my "fuck off" page for people trying to look for phpmyadmin on my own website? If I can get them to crash every time, I win :) 
ahahaha sounds like the perfect use. What kind of graphics card do you have? If someone can use it for something that is great. I wanted the simplex/Perlin noise for something I am trying to do and I was just playing around a little after I got the simplex thing into render.js from the C test program it came with. 
it's automated scripts doing the searching, not people with web browsers. It won't have any effect on a script that's just checking for presence of a file.
Nice work. I did a similar thing for Flash, I wrote a little program to turn an animation into a strip of jpeg+png plus a little info for frame count and handle position. 
It's lexical scope and it's how closures are implemented in JavaScript. You don't need it; jQuery author could choose to bind methods to a particular context, but that requires more overhead (executing a binding method), which is not really desirable in a library that is concerned with performance. Using closures is faster (sometimes), and easier to read (sometimes).
What's an advanced JavaScript user? The only "advanced" programming that I've ever seen done in JavaScript is from functional programmers who are experimenting with things like continuations and Y-combinators. I'm pretty sure those kinds of things aren't in most or any of these books.
Much like the jQuery echo chamber :/
New link (thank you)? I get: Forbidden You don't have permission to access /blog/essentialjsdesignpatterns/ on this server. Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.
For big stuff - MooTools (or Prototype). jQuery only if I need some small functionality to be added like animations, simple AJAX etc.
&gt; So with just XHR it's not possible at all! Correct, it is not possible by design. Which begs the question, why do you want the Location header?
I'm doing a random display of images from a site, which have a random url map, which in-turn does generates a random 307, which i'm trying to trap (: 
I get a forbidden when I try and access just the regular site.
Ah, I see. It's meant as an example of a bad design pattern.
Did link died?
if you can't find it you should first read the book *essential google: how to search for yourself*
jQuery because mootools patches prototypes and does not use namespaces. Not that jQuery is the best, but until someone comes around and writes something like mootools that does not resort to monkeypatching, no chance. Dojo probably works, but it's incredible bloated (at least it was when I looked the last time).
That site is actually a very bad representation of jQuery. In many places where he claims Mootools is more 'verbose', jQuery can often do the same thing, simply with a different syntax. jQuery is popular because while it can be very easy for someone to pick up and use simple functions, it can also be used in very complex cases by an advanced user using different syntax.
Link works for me. Here's the book: http://www.addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/
What is the use case? (Why do you need to use this method)
Reduced my number of trips to w3.org / time picking an AJAX helper should I go that route. Originally just did it to get a prototype of other stuff up and running. I'm not averse to switching over to a more... 'responsible' route, just curious as to the reasons for doing so.
How do you ensure your data has been loaded / fire a callback function to process the response? AFAIK this method is non-blocking (asynchronous), so any function after `getData()` wouldn't wait for the resource to load and its content to execute.
True, I've been tailing the responses with a function call, 'populate();'.
This is commonly used for asynchronous or cross-domain JS loading, when the target script supports callbacks that can execute once it finishes loading. The preferred method is the async attribute in the script tag, but that's obviously not supported everywhere yet.
You have two functions called validate_form(), combine them into one function.
What's with blink method in the first Validate_form's setTimeout? You're probably doing to have to define that one yourself. Try writing a function that takes an element's id and changes the id's css's visibility from visible to hidden several times over (with a delay of course).
That's the hint that my instructor wanted us to use instead of alert. He wanted us to have the text field blink to catch the user's attention rather than using the alert function.
I can get a lot more done with jQuery in a small amount of time, but it's not nearly as fast as Mootools when you are doing heavy lifting stuff.
I found this page very biased against jQuery. 
Instead of blink, I suggest to just make the border of the text field change color to red. here's a link to the blink method: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_blink.asp As you can see, it's not really supported anymore. 
just play around with it until you figure it out. Trust me--I'm not saying this to be a prick, but the chance that you learn something more than intended is greatly increased.
Here's my own humble advice: First of all, to get help; you have to help us help you. - Never post a screenshot of code. This makes it very hard to help you. If I want to try your code, or change it and show you how I would change it....I have to *retype* it. If you have code, post it to a pastebin like [pastie.org](http://pastie.org) [pastebin.org](http://pastebin.org) [pastebin.mozilla.org](http://pastebin.mozilla.org/) For a case like yours, even better is to upload a complete "test case". A "test case" here would be a complete small website which demonstrates your problem. For this, you would use something like [JS Fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net) [JS Bin](http://jsbin.com) - Get yourself an editor with syntax high-lighting and error detection, like Komodo Edit. Komodo Edit is free, runs on Linux, Window, and Mac...and awesome. - Use JSLint. [JSLint](http://jslint.com). There is also a jslint plugin for Komodo Edit. - This is probably not the best place to ask for help. This is a social news site. This sub-reddit is not terribly active, so I don't think most mind questions being asked here....but why ask here when there are so many better places? You'l get much quicker and better help on IRC or a place like stackoverflow. - Be as specific as possible as to what you need help with. Is there something in your code not working now? "Point me in the right direction" is only good if you have a very general question, but it seems like this is not the case. What you seem to have is several small questions.... You should try to ask stuff like: "I have some code right now but it doesn't run at all". "I have some code, I expected it to do X but it is doing Y instead". Break the problem down into small pieces and get help that way: "I need to make something blink, and I don't know how to do that." "I need to validate a field and I don't know how to do that." Those problems may need to be broken down even further: "How do I check the length of a string" ... etc etc Posting a description of your school assignment makes people less inclined to help you than a simple question. It also helps you help yourself better. It's easy to Google "How to make a div invisible" (the first step in blinking). It's not so easy to Google "How to do school assignment where my teacher wants us to validate a form and then make it blink if it's invalid and he gave me a hint but I'm not sure". - **LEARN HOW TO USE YOUR BROWSER'S DEVELOPER TOOLS: firebug, etc etc. If your code is not working, the first thing you should do is open the error console and see if there is an error. Pass this along with your question. Even better if you learn how to use the debugger; get good enough with it and you will rarely need outside help. On your code: - The majority of JS programmers use The One True Brace Style. There are some practical reasons for this, but the fact that it's by far the most common style is enough imho. This means your code (in terms of brace placement) would be formatted thusly: if (some_thing === true) { // Do stuff here } function getFunky() { //code } - You have semi-colons before your function declaration's opening brace. I think you may be confused about "semi-colons ending each line". You don't end each "actual" line with a semi-colon, you end each "logical" line with one. It's like the period at the end of a sentence. Consider this line: my_string = "foo" + some_other_string; You could write it as: my_string = "foo" + some_other_string; Not that you should in this case, but it demonstrates the idea that the semicolon goes at the end of the "sentence". - You have multiple script tags on your page, when it seems logically you should have one. Multiple scripts would make sense if you had two different scripts that are logically completely separate. That doesn't seem the case here.. You have a small set of functions which (apparently) belong together. - You have an implicit global variable. When you do: valid = true; This creates a global variable. In practice, your scripts should have very few truly global variables. Generally you enclose your code in a shared scope and have the necessary variables "global" only to your script, or exposed to the global scope as part of a namespace object. This is beyond the scope of your question and current abilities/needs, for now it suffices to say: Prefix all variable declarations with var so you don't go accidentally creating global variables. var valid = true; - In your example, I would just get rid of the valid variable altogether. I can understand the semantic nice-ness of return valid; ...but I think in this case return true; Is just as clear...actually this ties in with some other points. Part of the reason you seem to have two script tags, is you have two functions with the same name. The problem is, these two functions don't actually do what their function name implies. They are not validating a form, they are each validating a part of the form. A better way (imho) would be to have a function called something like function isValid(field){ if(field is not blank){ return true } return false } then you can have a function called validateForm or something like that inside do something like: if(!isValid(email){ flash(email, "You must enter an email address") } 
Man, it's kinda depressing seeing the quality of the code they're teaching :( But anyhow, here's some tips to get it working: 1. code in separate script tags aren't sandboxed. In other words, your second validate_form function is overwriting the first one. 2. document.getElementById(fieldid) isn't selecting anything (fieldid isn't defined). There may be better ways to do this, but for now you should just hardcode it in, i.e. document.getElementById('emaillbl') 3. Abstract out all the code used to make the blinking effect, and put it into its own function, so you'll call it like this: if(document.contact_form.emaillbl.value == "") { var div = document.getElementById('emaillbl'); blink(div, 10); // blink div on and off for 10 iterations } 4. Your blink function constructor will look like this: blink(element, iterationsRemaining) {} Do all the fancy styling stuff inside the blink function (it looks like you're on the right track) and then you'll have it call itself: function blink(element, iterationsRemaining) { // EDIT: forgot the function keyword, sorry // ... code here // call itself after all the styling magic setTimeout(function(){ blink(element, --iterationsRemaining); }, 500); } You'll want to remember to wrap the setTimeout in an If condition so it doesn't loop forever. Not sure how familiar you are with recursion.. I think this might be the main thing that's tripping you up. And for extra credit - this functionality is now part of HTML5 (the "required" attribute on form inputs), so for browsers that support it, it now works without JavaScript! // Sample code &lt;input type="text" required&gt; And there's a new "oninvalid" event to help after this gets triggered. Hoping this isn't too detailed to completely give away the solution, but I hope it's detailed enough that it helps.
Sorry about that, I forgot the function keyword in the blink function.
In response to your updated code: Sorry about that, I forgot the "function" keyword in my last comment. I think you're getting confused - the end result should only be two functions (they're declared globally, but it's ok for learning purposes). All your code will be in these functions. Any code outside of your functions will execute immediately, which you don't want to happen. This might be hard to get used to compared to other languages - JavaScript is event-based, and you define what happens during each event in your functions. You should use Firebug (for Firefox) or Chrome/Safari and use the Web Inspector tools (right click -&gt; inspect element -&gt; console), and it will let you know where the errors are in your code. I'd suspect you're probably getting an error here: { if (document.contact_form.contact_name.value == "") { alert ( "Please fill in the 'Your Name' box." ); valid = false; } return true; } I think you're getting this idea from Java. Unfortunately JavaScript doesn't have block scope[1] - everything in JavaScript has either global scope (which in your browser is a property of the window object) or functional scope (code within functions). What's happening is that you're creating a random object when you use curly braces: {} And you can assign it to a variable: var myObj = {}; // empty object And assign it properties and methods: var myObj = { myProperty = '', myMethod = function() { // we can create a function here because functions are first-class citizens! } } What's happening with your broken code is you're creating an object, and then trying to execute a conditional statement where you should be defining properties/methods instead, so the code is breaking there. You need to move that code into a function! [1] Technically JavaScript now has block scope if you use the new "let" keyword, which is supported in a few browsers. (let(x=5){})
Hmm, on second glance I'm not sure you're paying attention. You can't just copy and paste things from everywhere and mash it together to get it to work. I helped you out with the blink function, but I don't think you understand how to integrate it with your own code (where is the "i" variable being defined?).
First of all, clean up your HTML. It's a mess--missing title tag, deprecated tags, missing attributes, unquoted attributes, mis-matched closing tags, XHTML-style closings, yet no DOCTYPE declared, formatting is horrible... Second, stop copying and pasting suggestions and read what people are saying. Just step back and look at what you're doing. In your current code, even on an error, you're returning true, thus, submitting the form. You're referencing 'i' to count iterations, but nowhere do you actually set it (nor, for that matter, do you need to). The same can be said for your 'valid' variable. I'm not trying to be harsh or pick on you, but if you don't write neat, clean code, you will only confuse yourself and make learning that much harder. It will also make debugging harder, and you'll end up with stupid errors because you just couldn't read the code well. Finally, if you plan on doing this for a job and write code like that, your co-workers will kill you in your sleep. None of us want to see you beheaded. If you don't try to attempt to understand and apply code samples, you will end up with a copy/pasted answer in which you haven't learned anything which, judging from the poorly authored HTML (the easiest part) seems to be your current approach. Stop that! :p If you are legitimately trying to learn it and are just struggling with it *that* much, my apologies. I hate to just hand you the answer, because I'm afraid you'll just copy/paste and not learn from it. But at this point, it also looks like you're so lost on it that if you don't have it explained to you, you're not going to understand it anyway. So I'll attempt to break it down. This is absurdly heavily commented, so please read it. It explains the process in great detail and contains links to appropriate reference materials. Here's how I would do it at 2:30am: http://pastie.org/1301905
This will hurt my feelings.
I'm seriously trying to get a grasp on this. My instructor for the class basically jumped straight into javascripting and I have no prior knowledge of using this code. Fortunately, I'm not going to get a job that requires me to use javascripting or html. I really do appreciate your patience and understanding. Also, I can understand if you're fairly frustrated with my approach because I really have no clue.
No problem. I don't mind a bit helping out if you're seriously trying. It's just that from looking at things, it was hard to tell if you were lost or lazy. :D I really do recommend that you try and make your code as consistently clean and well-formatted as possible, though. In the end, it will save you a lot of hassle and headache. I realize part of the problem with the formatting might have been Reddit's display of it. Good luck with it. Just let me know if you have any questions on the code. I tried to be thorough, but sometimes it's hard for me to look at it from the perspective of someone who doesn't know anything about the code and I will overlook something.
I honestly do appreciate everyone's help and advice in this and I hope I'm not coming across as lazy or anything. I'll be the first to admit that I am no master at javascript coding nor at html for that matter. At this point I'm seriously just going to scrap this and start over while going over this post to try and piece things together while attempting to know what I'm doing. &gt;.&gt; &lt;3 reddit.
I'll save jslint the trouble: "Come on, how hard is it REALLY to put all your variable declarations at the top of the function. I mean SERIOUSLY."
When are people going to stop rewording the home page for node.js and start writing actual node.js code ?
The only real issue here is you now have to edit server-side code for when you want to update the name of the client-side function that handles your callback. Sure you can avoid this by submitting a callback in your path and handling that server-side, but then you are opening up your data to developers on other domains. For example, a developer can now make a cross-domain request to your script, passing it their own callback (or even having a callback client-side matching the name you are forcing your callback to be), and with no other overhead have access to this data you are serving. Simply returning data by using an actual ajax helper client side (assuming you don't have to go cross-domain, then this entire point is moot) would require other developers trying to rip your data to CURL (or similar) and handle manipulating the raw data before gaining access. If you need cross-domain requests to be handled, this is really your only solution (it is in essence what JSONP does), but you are really better off picking a library (jquery, prototype, etc) that has really solid built-in ajax support and using their simpler methods, or finding a minimal ajax-only library that you can utilize.
Wasn't there a mention in this subreddit just the other day about how jslint couldn't be accepted in a code repository because of the added one liner in the license? 
"longetivity"? :-)
FWIW, Palm's WebOS browsers are built on webkit. Making AJAX requests this way is literally 50 times faster than using the Prototype-based AJAX handler in their SDK. I've never tried to benchmark any other browser this way, so YMMV.
jQuery has been so good to me I've never wanted to look at anything else.
Ahh there are so many existing JSON-templating solutions, yet people keep inventing them anyway. Is there really a better solution than HAML (which already has server-side and client-side rendering)? I think the more interesting thing about this is not the JS but the Python compatibility. Nevertheless, HAML is much more straightforward, efficient, and widely used.
Interesting to see MS donating some plugins to jQuery. Kudos?
&gt; yet people keep inventing them anyway. Probably because on one hand, it is a fairly easy problem to solve, yet on the other none of the existing solutions have really become dominant. So now I'm going to go look up HAML.
&gt;The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil. That one?
 * [HAML main site](http://haml-lang.com/) * [jQuery-HAML](https://github.com/creationix/jquery-haml) * [HAML-JS](https://github.com/creationix/haml-js) (for Node.js) I haven't used HAML with Python but there are implementations in various stages such as * [HamlPy](https://github.com/jessemiller/HamlPy) * [DAML](https://github.com/dasacc22/daml), and * [GHRML](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/GHRML/0.11)
My version would be something like: function myObjectFactory() { var self = { foo: function () { console.log(1, self); (function () { console.log(2, self); }()); setTimeout(function () { console.log(3, self); }, 100); } }; return self; } var myObject = myObjectFactory(); myObject.foo(); but each to their own.
Yes, that last came up [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/e4lek/i_am_looking_for_a_lexer_written_in_javascript/), although doing a search for "jslint" and "troll" in this subreddit brings up a bit of a recurring theme. 
The thing is that your version won't work with prototypes, nor can you dynamically rebind `this`/`self` with `Function.prototype.bind` because `self` is the actual object being closed over, rather than the dynamically bound `this`.
Well, strictly speaking your original problem statement didn't involve prototypes either - though I do agree that your solution would work for prototypes. My current opinion is that prototypes and 'this' - while powerful - are dangerous, or at best confusing (as exemplified in your blog posting), and closures provide a perfectly good alternative.
I'd like to see a Python implementation of jquery-tmpl, since it's going to go into jQuery core soon anyway.
I'm amenable to JSONP-esque cross domain access. I'm working on a computer availability app for my uni's library, I'm into encouraging 3rd party interfaces and such.
That is extremely useful information! Perhap's I'll stick with this request. Any ideas as to the efficacy of using long-polling for push capabilities with this method? Browsers always seem to have dumb-long timeouts.
From my blog post: &gt; I find this syntactic helper especially nice when defining prototypes or extending existing objects. These situations tend to rely on state that is stored in this more often than other examples, so I find the utility added by binding this to self also tends to be greater. ;)
This is the first explanation I've seen of this stuff that actually puts it in perspective, thanks for posting.
//Nice! some fuxin: drawPlane = function drawPlane(list) { var asp, i, z; //wave calc z = -10 + Math.sin( (list[0][0]+clock)/15) * 12 + Math.sin( (list[0][1]+clock)/20) * 8; ctx.beginPath(); for (i = 0; i &lt; list.length; i++) { var r1 = Math.random(), r2 = Math.random(); asp = aspect( list[i][0], list[i][1], z); asp[0] = (1.64)*asp[0]; asp[1] = asp[1] &gt; 2/(1/asp[1]+1/asp[0]) ? .64 * asp[1] : asp[0]; if (i==0) { ctx.moveTo( asp[0], asp[1] ); } else { ctx.lineTo( asp[0], asp[1] ); } if (i==list.length-1) { asp = aspect( list[0][0], list[0][1], z); ctx.lineTo( asp[0], asp[1] ); } } //ctx.stroke(); ctx.fill(); } Style = function Style() { ctx.fillStyle = "rgb(255,255,255)"; ctx.strokeStyle = "rgb(0,0,0)"; ctx.clearRect( ctx,canvas.width, ctx.canvas.height); ctx.fillRect( 0, 0, ctx.canvas.width, ctx.canvas.height); } ctx.canvas.height *= 1.5; ctx.canvas.width *= 1.5;

SHITTING DICKS that is fucking nice. If you don't mind, I might hax atop your engine in the near future.
go for it, glad dix were shat :)
lolz - missed that part. Though today I learned that the style I espouse is also the one recommended by Douglas Crockford in his "JavaScript: the good parts". I should probably write a more decent post as to why I think it's a good idea.
Hmmm. HAML looks interesting but it doesn't seem to do the same thing. It looks like JSON template lets you use an arbitrary js object to inject into an html template, while HAML supposes that you control the JSON object. Different use cases, but they both look useful.
Either it's not working in FF4b7 or some of the resources it requires are being blocked by my work filter. 
Sounds like a good plan to me :)
In either case you can separate the template and the object and control them independently. And as **snifty** pointed out in another comment -- if you just want HTML templates with JSON objects, **jquery-tmpl** is mature and will shortly be the most widely adapted method, as it's supported by Microsoft and headed for jQuery core.
What does this have to do with HTML5? It's just canvas. It has been around for years.
It works in Opera exactly like in Chrome except the rotating not at all.
First, you understand that JavaScript and Java are not the same thing, right?
Isn''t this the Javascript subreddit?
It is but you need help with **Java** not Javascript. There's a Java subreddit : http://www.reddit.com/r/java It looks a bit dead though so maybe try : http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/
you are not reassigning the value of "mycar" anywhere, you are simply setting a new object inside myFunc.
I believe it's because you are creating a new object and updating the reference within the function, but not the main reference. If you instead had theObject.make = "Ford", that would alter the object you are referencing.
By using theObject = {make: "Ford", model: "Focus", year: 2006}; You are now creating a new object with those properties, and not referring to the one you passed in. If you used theObject.make = 'Ford'; then you would be getting the results you expected.
I think I get it now actually. So if I'm getting this right what happens is first you pass myCar to myfunc so myCar can be accessed through theObject within myFunc, but then on the next line (theObject = {make: "Ford", model: "Focus", year: 2006};) the variable theObject is assigned to something else making myCar no longer accessible from within myFunc?
&gt;When calling myFunc wouldn't myCar be passed by reference In Javascript there is no "pass by reference", arguments are passed by *value*. If I do: myFunc(x){ // Do somthing }; var x = {foo: "bar"}; myFunc(x); The *value* of x is passed. In this particular case the value of x happens to be a reference to an object in memory, but re-assigning x just replaces that value with another. x is not itself a reference to the object, it just holds a reference to the object. If you were to modify x, that would work.
theObject is a reference to the object you pass in. As a reference to an object, you can modify any of that object's attributes if you like. (For example, you can have theObject.make = "Ford"; and your original object will be modified). By setting theObject to a whole new thing altogether, you're no longer modifying a reference, you're just reassigning the local variable named theObject to have a different value.
&gt; you're just reassigning the local variable named theObject to have a different value. Perfect, thanks man.
In JavaScript, most things are passed by value, but somethings (ie: objects) are passed by reference. function setAge(person,age) { person.age = age; } var person = { name: "Test", age: 0 } setAge(person,10); console.log(person); person.age is now 10 - the person object was passed by reference, not by value. function setAge(startAge,age) { startAge = age; } var testAge =0; setAge(testAge,10); testAge remains zero - it was passed by value, not by reference. If you want to pass an object by value and not by reference, you need to clone it first, and pass the cloned version.
This is the JavaScript subreddit. You do need help with JavaScript for Google Docs. The confusion is because you wrote: &gt;I know it's in Java, so maybe that means someone here can help? The advice given in the Java subreddit to try [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) is probably your best bet.
Ummm.... I think the OP just had a slight confusion that 'Java' is not an appropriate abbreviation of 'Javascript' - Google Apps Scripts are all written in Javascript, so he is indeed asking in the correct place. Unfortunately, I've never touched the app script api, and don't have the time to delve in, so I can't be much help except to clarify. 
Your way of stating it is rather common, but I disagree with it because I think it leads to confusion such as OP's case. (also, it's wrong) All arguments in JS are passed by value. In your example, you have an object in memory (in the heap) { name: "Test", age: 0 } ... and person, which points to it (from the stack). When you call: setAge(person,...) You are passing the **value** of person, which is a reference (or "pointer") to an object in memory. There is an actual copying process involved, JS takes whatever part of the stack person is and clones it. That's why in your second example testAge is still zero. It copies the part of the stack testAge refers to... in this case a primitive value, and gives it to a local variable - age. You now have two "0"'s, so of course changing one does not change the other. In the first case, what's contained in the stack is a pointer to an object in the heap. So when it's copied, you just end up with two pointers to the same object. I disagree with calling this "passing by reference" because that implies you could do something like OP is trying. That is not "passing **by** reference" it is "passing **a** reference", and I think it's clearer to just state the truth: that everything is passed by value. I can see why you would call that "passing by reference", but I disagree with it. 
In my largest project, I was in your shoes for a long time by (stupidly!) coming to rely on a particular version of GNU cpp (newer versions refuse to preprocess JavaScript), m4, and a random hodge-podge of scripts. I managed to replace the majority of the pipeline with Google Closure compiler/library, which works really hard to evaluate JS during the compilation process. This evaluation mostly does away with the need for macros, since you can just write normal JavaScript functions / @const'd variables, which Closure will inline/compute: /** @const */ var DEBUG = false; /** @const */ var BLAH = 'blah blah'; function someMacro(s) { return (DEBUG ? s : s.toUpperCase()) + 'FOO'; } // Becomes 'document.title="BLAH BLAHFOO"; // someMacro definition will be omitted entirely if there are // no non-constant calls to it. document.title = someMacro(BLAH); As for the rest of it, I still use GNU make, as there are simply too many fiddly little project-specific bits and pieces that I'd never expect any half-sane framework to be able to encapsulate without coming out worse than just simply writing a Makefile. After working with Closure for a while, I've come to realize that most of what I wanted was actually a decent JavaScript compiler, rather than yet another layer of random string replacements going on at the source code layer (something that some would say was a huge mistake in the design of C!). The other upshot of Closure's approach is that it doesn't actually *need* Closure in order to run - all the source code remains completely valid, executable JavaScript. So in a way you gain a lot of portability.
I was thinking something more powerful than just string replacement, that's one of the things the other (js-specific) preprocessors I've tried lacked. I like being able to call Javascript inline in templates and I thought that'd be cool to do to code. Still not sure though. How much of this is Closure in-lining? Am I mistaken or is someMacro() getting called at runtime? You get some benefit from in-lining DEBUG and BLAH, but it's still re-direction. With closure, would I be able to write a macro to do something like replace Math.pow(x, 2) with ((x) * (x)) inline? (just as an example) What about something more advanced, like inserting the output of some operation into the source? One thing I was thinking was I wanted to make it really obvious what code was compile-time and what was run-time... I'm still not sure, but I was thinking perhaps a special sigil and enclosing brackets or something. I've been hung up on the issue of what would happen if it wasn't run through the pre-processor, but I think in most cases people would either be consuming the code and could just be provided an already processed lib, or they would be on my team and it wouldn't be as much of an issue. I'm not sure though. As for random string re-placement I definitely am skeptical of it...it's magic and magic is dangerous. Yet I can't help but feel it would be useful in some cases. If your example works like I think it does, it will have some dead code, which is not too bad, but could be avoided with string replacement. One problem I have is I like to stick debug code everywhere so I can just sit back and watch things without having to step through it with a debugger. So I get code like var x = requestBangarang(); DEBUG(x); x.sendMessage(y, "BANGARANG!"); DEBUG(y); I could do something like: /** @const */ var DEBUG_MODE = false; /** @const */ var BLAH = 'blah blah'; function DEBUG(s) { if (!DEBUG_MODE) return; // do some stuff } ...but then my code will be littered with DEBUG calls, and it will drag performance. It seems I've got to choose between optimizing for the processed code (cpp et al), or the unprocessed code(closure). You've given me some stuff to check out, thanks.
Closure's inlining is really insane - it seems to work recursively on almost any set of functions with no side-effects and with constant inputs. I'm not sure what its limits are (presumably, e.g. setting a global variable from inside a function will break it), but e.g. this works: $ cat a.js /** @define */ var DEBUG = true; /** @const */ var MULTIPLIER = 4; /** @const */ var NUMBER = 0xCAFE; /** @const */ var MAGIC = 0xBABE; function doFirstBit(x, y) { return ''+(x * y); } function doSecondBit(x, y) { if(DEBUG) { return x + doFirstBit(NUMBER, MULTIPLIER) + y; } } alert(doSecondBit(MAGIC, 2)); $ ./closure.sh &lt; a.js 2&gt;/dev/null alert("478062078642"); $ ./closure.sh --define=DEBUG=false &lt; a.js 2&gt;/dev/null alert("undefined"); As for pulling in results from external programs, text files, etc., in that project I have a 'config.py', which contains all application-specific constants. I have a script called during make that uses Python's `json` module to walk the contents of that `config` module and print a set of `/** @const */ build.config.VARIABLE = json-encoded-value`. This is written to a `build/config.js`, `build` is included in the Closure `calcdeps.py` search path, and my main project then just calls `goog.require('build.config');` to get at those constants.
Wow, that is pretty slick. I'll definitely be diving into closure, I think it will take care of most things. I still might end up building a preprocessor for fun/those cases where it's needed, but this is awesome. Now I'm wondering about the other closure tools, any experience with them? If so, How are they?
Closure Library is _really annoyingly verbose_, but its coding style is particularly well suited to the compiler. For example, despite the name, Closure cannot optimise closures. :) Closure Library thusly uses very few of them. It's also heavily namespaced, so e.g. a jQuery-like `$('#foo')` becomes `goog.dom.getElementById('foo')` or worse. If you're willing to put up with this verbosity, in return however, your app will compile to smaller than the size of jQuery itself. In particular, after compilation, Closure knows to rename `goog.dom.getElementById` to something like 'A'. :)
Prototype's build process uses [Sprockets](http://getsprockets.org/) for concatenation/preprocessing, [PDoc](http://pdoc.org) for generating docs, and [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) to hook it all up via the command line. Naturally, this is a Ruby toolset, but hopefully it gives you some inspiration.
where do you find information like that? It's fascinating. I've read TGP but I'm sure I don't remember that level of detail.
Yeah basically. Technically its still accessible (via the arguments array, and perhaps via the global object), but not via the theObject reference. Its basically the difference between object mutation, and reference reassignment. Manipulating one of the references to an object doesn't affect the object itself, and manipulating the object itself doesn't affect any the references. This means, that you can't create a swap() function in JavaScript like you could using pointers in C or C++. Many other languages also work this way (Java, and PHP to some extent, etc...).
&gt; All arguments in JS are passed by value. That statement is not true. Objects are passed by reference. This is not confusing at all, and it certainly not wrong.
http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-262.pdf The standard.
Ah, I missed the 'script' part of 'google apps script'. Thought s/he was using the App Engine.
Eval/with are somewhat obvious. Same goes for f-ing with arguments. That E4X stuff is pretty obscure. So yea, it's great to have a complete list. But I really don't get this one: &gt;declares an initialized var or const named arguments Can some explain what that's supposed to mean?
know if/where I can get that in hard copy? Amazon gives me nothing.
As far as I know, you cannot. However, there's nothing particularly wrong with tossing it on a POD printer like Lulu or CafePress, buying it from yourself, then taking it down.
Do note there are other standards of interest, too. 327 and 257 may be of particular interest to you.
I'm guessing it means var arguments = &lt;whatever&gt;;
Ohhh... why the f- would anyone do that? But I think you're right. :)
&gt; contains (possibly nested in intervening functions) a flat closure that uses upvars in the function in question, which cannot be flattened (copied into the flat closure because they are not initialized only with the closure post-dominating the initialization) I don't understand this one. 
It sounds something like: function bar() { var g; var f = function() { g = 1; } f(); } But I've never heard the term "flat closure" before.
I've done some googling and it appears you're right. A flat closure is a closure that does not rely on variables from the enclosing scope. Flattening your example would look something like; function bar() { var g = 0; var f = function(x) { x = 1; return x; }; g = f(g); } 
You might be surprised at the amount of people that don't realize arguments is a property of the function object.
The 3D part I reccon.
if you still prefer getting stuff in your feed reader (i do), you can subscribe to the rss for a twitter user.. they're public, no account required. 
So, what does this mean in terms of code execution? There's a couple thing here that I know I've done in code before, such as changing the value of an argument. Not `arguments` itself, mind you, but say something like `if (foo==undefined) foo = 'bar';` Is there a noticeable performance loss by doing something like that?
In almost every example, jQuery syntax is cleaner than YUI's. I was planning to learn and use YUI for my next JavaScript project, but now I'm not sure. Is there anything YUI makes better than jQuery?
In short, it means you should not concern yourself with implementation details like this discussed on the developers' bug tracker, otherwise you'll get confused, which you did... :) The `arguments` object is an alternative magical array-like object for manipulating a function's arguments, e.g.: function sum(a, b) { arguments[0] = 1; // 'a' now bound to 1 return a+b; } sum(50, 50); // Always 51. 
It is absolutely true. Go back and re-read my post and you'll see why. Arguments are *not* passed by reference. If they were, you could do what OP is doing. A lot of people get confused because you can do this var foo = {fizz: "bam"}; function change(x){ f.fizz = "buzz"; } change(foo); // foo.fizz is now "buzz" They **mistakenly** think this means (some) arguments are passed by reference. This is not the case. It's confusing because it's wrong....that's why this post exists. If you could pass by reference then OP could do what they are trying to do. OP is confused because someone told them "objects are passed by reference", therefore I say the phrase is confusing. The reason my example is call-by-value is because, as I said before...there is an actual **copying** process happening. When you have a function function change(x); When you call it JS takes whatever variable you pass to it and **COPIES** it into x. When I call change(foo); JS takes the **VALUE** of foo (which is a pointer to an object in the heap) and **COPIES** it. There are now **TWO** pointers to the same object. I can see why people call this "pass by reference" but it is not strictly true and leads to confusion.
I don't remember exactly; just reading a lot of blogs, books, and talking to people on IRC. In another comment you mentioned getting a physical book, and the book I generally recommend is "Professional Javascript For Web Developers" by Nicholas C Zakas. I've read half a dozen books on JS and it's probably the best (though I'm sure there's other great ones I haven't read yet). TGP is a very good book, but to me it's sort of like "The Art of War". Army Generals today should read it, but they also need "Predator Drone Operations Manual"(etc) As someone else mentioned, the standards are good to browse, though I've never sat down and tried to read it straight through.
Yea, I've looked at Sprockets in the past and it's one of the inspirations for what I was thinking about. The main reason I haven't done much with it is it's based on Ruby and I'm hoping for something Java and/or Python based, though I'll probably end up giving it a go.
&gt; Is there anything YUI makes better than jQuery? Do you mean strictly in terms of syntax? "cleaner" is subjective, and I think in a lot of these examples it's arguable whether jQuery is really "cleaner", though in a lot of cases it's certainly more concise. (cleaner to me entails more than pure conciseness, maybe not so for others) There's definitely a difference in style. I like jQuery's sugared and functional style but sometimes you want something that's more explicit and clear. You may also need or want things that require the the more verbose syntax, and so accept it as a trade-off.
thanks, I'll investimagate that :)
All very Python specific: I use a Python toolset to assemble Javascript code. We packaged up quite a few Javascript libraries as Python libraries, just shipping the JS code that way. Then we piggy-pack on top of the Python tools (such as setuptools, distribute, buildout) to assemble applications. In your Python code, if you need a Javascript library to be in a certain web page (and this python code is called from this web page), then you can do things like: from hurry.jqueryui import jqueryui ... jqueryui.need() ... This tells the system to include jqueryui and its dependencies on the web page. We use [hurry.resource](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.resource) and its WSGI middleware to make sure the right links according to the right dependencies show up. We're working on a way to publish javascript resources from WSGI middleware too, but right now your web framework will have to take care of this. I've been looking into whether I can also integrate CommonJS and/or RequireJS packaged libraries into the mix, so that I don't have package Javascript libraries in fake Python packages anymore, but there's little progress there so far. 
The reference is passed by value.
"By value" means that the object itself is cloned and pushed onto the stack. "By reference" means that a pointer to the object is pushed onto the stack, but that the object is stored only once on the heap. I'm not disagreeing with your understanding of the language. I'm disagreeing with your definition of "by value" vs "by reference". Copying a pointer doesn't count as copying.
I actually mean in more than syntax. While I like jQuery style more than YUI's, this is not a deal breaker. In terms of performance, ease of use, community and even documentation, I still prefer jQuery. However, I'm interested enough in YUI to give it a shot, but I'm not sure if there is anything unique enough to try it. I used YUI 2 for a huge JavaScript project a few years ago. When YUI 3 came out I was highly dissapointed that now my codebase was junk, and I got very dissapointed with YUI. Porting all that code to YUI 3 is almost as difficult as writing it again in jQuery, so I don't know if it's worth learning YUI 3 at this point.
Have you looked at the source code? He's not using WebGL. He calculates all the coordinates manually and uses good old polygons to draw them. It has nothing to do with HTML5.
My gripe is they didn't included the latest Google Chrome betas (9.0.576.0) in this test, and instead stuck with Chrome ver 8.0 The DCE optimizations, IMO are quite valid. 
I saw this almost 10 yrs ago from Ipix.
I won't be running it, but this is still a good thing. 
"Dead code elimination" that can be disturbed by an empty return or an inserted "true" or changing a while to a for is basically a useless gimmick. 
This is like the tech demo of tech demos quicktime, realplayer, flash, they all have a tech demo like this. This time it's native to the page it's on, just HTML and JavaScript.
Nice! No more applets :P
I think that's a fairly good argument for providing a static browser code form for when you want simple fast speed. JavaScript has advanced leaps and bounds in performance in the last few years but I fear it's going to get tougher going further. Be it NativeClient style, LLVM bytecode, or even the tiny C compiler with a DOM interface. Something that runs the same everywhere but can be optimised by the host system, sacrificing flexibility for speed. 
Yeah, but it's kinda slow... http://jsperf.com/dom-vs-innerhtml-based-templating/33
I think it was finally determined that IE9 does DCE very wrong, and its not that easy to do in javascript. E.g. they assume that. a function that just does `a + b` and no return or assignment has no side effects. They left out the case where a or b is an object, which means valueof() is called, which *can* have side effects. Basically.. IE9 definitly *is* faster... because its not executing the code. tl;dr I can also write a JS engine that beats everybody else. It replaces all your code with `return;`
It was revealed that they [might actually be cheating](http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2010/11/lies-damned-lies-and-benchmarks-is-ie9-cheating-at-sunspider.ars).
It might be worth it to port Sprockets over to Python. (There's a [PHP port](https://github.com/stuartloxton/php-sprockets), for instance.) Even if you want extra features, it might make sense to build something that uses a superset of Sprockets syntax. (You'd get a bunch of unit tests for free, or nearly so.)
I should clarify - Their DCE optimizations are buggy, but the concept of DCE optimization is valid and CAN work... just not yet :)
Bingo!
the truth is I'm a newbie. i assumed canvas was a feature of html5 so that's why I put it in the title.
Stack Overflow is amazing, all the answers to any questions are in there.
@sideral -- The YUI 2-in-3 project is a good way to make a transition of a larger project dependent on YUI 2-specific functionality: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/examples/yui/yui-compat.html
Thanks for mentioning it. There's also http://coder.io/tag/javascript
that's nice, let me know when it beats them in CSS3 support
Personally, I wouldn't care at all about IE when they'd just got their shit together and not be the retarded one you have to spent like 40% of your development time on after implementing your stuff that ad hoc works in all other browsers with minor inconsistencies.
There's a lot of Haskell for an article on JavaScript.
I am not sure (as I have not used YUI much) but it looks like this is from someone familiar with jQuery, trying to do jQuery things in YUI, not someone familiar with YUI trying to do things in jQuery.
Is there a tldr for this?
He talks a lot about higher order array functions but doesn't mention ES5's new array methods for just that. For example, his sum example in ES5: arr.reduce(function(sum, val) { return sum + val });
It's not Haskell, it's [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/).
Ah! Damn. I knew my browser (FF 3.....) supported Canvas, so I thought it wasn't working due to the lack of WebGL....... Cool ta..... I wonder why it's not working?
&gt;the truth is I'm a newbie. But! You write well, Um - just to JavaScript? &gt;i assumed canvas was a feature of html5 so that's why I put it in the title. Ahh! got it. I'm off to find a bug, it's not renderin' in my browser... great source, thanks for sharing!

YAY! I got it to work! It looks great! Also... new to programming? How old are you? You're a natural. =)
After syntax, there's a lot of little philosophical or architectural differences. YUI imho is more about providing you with widgets and tools, it's modular and you say what you need and YUI loads the modules you need. jQuery is more a tight core library and you have to import plugins and such to extend functionality. I don't think there's anything you can build in one where you can turn around and say "HA! try doing THAT with [other library]" it's just more about little differences that might make one fit what you are doing, your needs, and your development style more than the other.
Meh.
Heya, Thanks for pointing out the clearRect problem- I would never have spotted it ! The programming i'm pretty new to- started learning Python a couple of months back, and then some html and JS because I am interesting in web design. ...what's WebGL? Also, I'm 20. Thankyou for the kind words : )
I actually had a discussion once about whether or not the functional paradigm was helped or hurt by Haskell.
functions can pass functions and return functions, and you can mix data in.
I wonder how the others got it to work, and why no one else noticed the error!? I got the impression it worked straight out of the box for them?
20! Ace! You'd have a good future in programming. WebGL Is Open GL via webpages and javascript. Open GL is a framework for controlling 3D graphics cards. It's a parallel to Direct 3D, they've been racing a long time.
I think some browsers ignore faulty commands and simply pass them by. In that case instead of clearing the screen and then filling it with white, it would have just drawn the white over the top of everything; so practically the same thing.
Haha thanks a lot. I will have to do some reading up on that. Atm I'm working on generalizing the 3d&gt;2d function to make a sort of browser based game or menu thing. 
+1 on "JavaScript Patterns" by Stoyan Stefanov
So I mainly wrote this as a response to "Pythonic JavaScript Methods" from earlier this week, but it's an interesting enough topic. Apologies for glaring grammar mistakes but I wrote it in a single pass (and it's time for bed).
maybe you want to head over to /r/css - this group is about JavaScript
for people having to care about ghetto browsers, there's always the ghetto getter! It goes something like this var myObject = { /* whatever, dude */ }; myObject.prop = function() { /* getter code goes here */ return Math.random(); }; myObject.prop.valueOf= function() { return this(); }; yes, it's terrible, and things like "typeof myObject.prop" won't return what a real getter would, and if you're not careful, you'll end up passing a function around instead of the value you want, but overall you still get to pretend you have getters even though you really don't. Fun aside, note that the examples on the blog implicitly rely on the order of keys seen in a for (in) loop is not only constant, but consistent across browsers, when the order is left undefined in the ecmascript spec. Thar be dragons. 
Got around to it last night. http://hivedev.blogspot.com/2010/11/case-for-functional-inheritance.html
Maybe I missed something - but with your example, looks like anyone who asks for myObject.prop will now get an un-invoked function. And I'm not even touching the valueOf assignment :-) (getters are overrated troublemakers anyway :-) ) Updated the article to recognize your serious note.
Don't know much about js animation, but I heard about this, maybe it can halp you: [Spritely](http://www.spritely.net/)
It's totally true. It'll only "work" when you do something that causes the value to be resolved in some way, meaning you could end up running the "getter" much later than you'd hoped (hey, lazy evaluation! It's a feature!), or not at all.. it's not terribly practical, overall, but if you happen to write code around it just right, you can make someone looking at your code wonder how you appear to have getters in a scripting environment that shouldn't allow it. \*edit: Alright, time for some Forbidden JavaScript Lore^(tm) . On one of the early incarnations of Javascript (in Netscape 3.0 browsers), javascript objects had another "magic" method, named [`assign`](http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/web/jscript/ch07_07.html#ch07-SECT2-AUTOID.7). The way it worked is, when you'd do `a = b`, the operation would be a regular assignment *unless* `a` was already pointing to an object with an `assign` method defined, in which case it was equivalent to calling `a.assign(b)`. This, in retrospect, was not terribly consistent with the rest of the language flavor, and it disappeared in Netscape 4.0. Nonetheless, it meant Netscape 3.0 scripts could have a "setter" implementation, after a fashion. 
I'm pretty sure [Raphaël JS](http://raphaeljs.com/) has everything you need. Start there.
Thanks for the recommendation, but I'm looking something more the 'how-to' of this kind of stuff ;)
SO is better suited to asking questions. I would recommend just posting a link to the SO question
So Google around for some tutorials, dude. Also come show us what you've done when you produce something awesome!
thanks
To be honest, I think using excel/Google spreadsheet for this is just asking for trouble. You are using a spreadsheet program to create a "form" like look to your data and your data is now scattered trough out different cells/rows and somewhere in between the lines you have some scripts/logic throwing the data into another place. What happens when the store owner wants todo some reporting based on this data? How can you pull anything out from this one? I am almost 100% sure there is billing/order management programs out there that cost little to no (open source) money at all. Get one and use that instead. You (or the shop owner) will thank me later. EDIT: The benefit of having a real order management system is that the data will be stored in a database, depending on tool/software, it will have built in reporting tools and other things to help with the orders.
The fun thing about these is that if you go on MDC and [look them up](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array), they include JavaScript implementations as well for browsers that don't have native support. I've written so much code in JS with those that I can't really imagine not using them anymore.
Crockford is awesome and JSLint is super useful, but we definitely don't see eye to eye when it comes to whitespace and line-breaking. Fortunately everything is based on the options you choose for linting so I can avoid the hurt feelings.
Mootools vs jQuery are comparable with the exception that Mootools has a class system and jQuery does not have anything of the sort. Generally speaking they're both very easy to pick up and provide you with much of the same functionality. jQuery is ridiculously popular and easy to learn so if you're a front-end dev, there's no reason not to learn it. But things like YUI and Dojo and Sencha are in a different class altogether - designed mostly for one-page, "rich internet application" type of deals. 
Have you looked at [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org)? It allows you to create modules and specify dependencies in your JavaScript, and then run your files through an optimization tool that creates one or more production-ready "layers" from your files. It also handles minification using Closure Compiler. Highly recommend it. 
**Step 1**: Learn some vector maths. *If you don't know this well, you will be lost for the rest of your life when trying to do graphics. Vectors simplify trigonometry.* **Step 2**: Learn some linear algebra. *You need this to do any complex animations.* **Step 3**: Get a book called "Computer Graphics: Principles and Practices". *This book will be your bible.* **Step 4**: Practice. Practice. Practice. Learning enough in Steps 1-3 should only take you a week or so. After that, you will have enough of a foundation to begin a more thorough investigation of computer graphics and animation techniques.
I wrote a library [Doodle.js](https://github.com/biilly/doodle-js), in the [examples](http://biilly.github.com/doodle-js/doc/demos/making_things_move/) I ported the book code from [Making Things Move](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590597915) - which goes into more detail about how the examples work. That should get you going.
This (if you ignore the dojo-specific build process) is easily the best in the biz. Not only does it offer file structure and async module loading, it has a incredibly optimized build step to boot. A++ would execute again.
Exactly this is what I'm looking for, thanks a lot! I'm already checkin out the Chapter 3 of the book and it's awesome! 
Nice, that's what I'm aiming, to create some stuff like that and get into canvas (better late than never) Thanks
Needs to be fixed to work in ie7/ie8 at least, otherwise this is pretty limited in use.
I'd really recommend taking advantage of console.log().. it can really reveal what's going on here: function myFunc(theObject) { console.log(theObject.make); // Honda console.log(mycar.make); // Honda (accessible because mycar is global) theObject = {make: "Ford", model: "Focus", year: 2006}; console.log(theObject.make); // Ford console.log(mycar.make); // Honda } var mycar = {make: "Honda", model: "Accord", year: 1998}; var x = mycar.make; // Honda myFunc(mycar); // returns null var y = mycar.make; // Honda Even if you return something from the function, it's not affecting mycar. Here's what you're probably trying to accomplish: function myFunc(theObject) { return {make: "Ford", model: "Focus", year: 2006}; } var mycar = {make: "Honda", model: "Accord", year: 1998}; var x = mycar.make; // Honda mycar = myFunc(mycar); // returns a new object and assigns it to mycar var y = mycar.make; // Ford
CSS3 doesn't work well in IE7/8 (/troll), but aside from that, what I can tell from looking at it in a CSS3 enabled browser, is that it doesn't even look like coverflow.
Tried it out - it was wrong 100% of the time.
Wrong 100% of the time? Heck. Sounds great to me. If it says it's good then you know it's bad. If it says it's bad, then you know it's good. Heck, that's easier than the two guards puzzle. http://brainden.com/forum/index.php?/topic/7310-two-guards/
Using colour classifiers to check for 'proportion of bare skin' (15% in this case) just isn't going to work very well. Lighting conditions, grayscale images and so on ad nauseam will screw it up. I applaud the effort though.
Excusing the lack of reflections, I think it does a pretty good job - at very least it certainly does look and perform similarly to coverflow.
Except it rotates the cover on the wrong axis, isn't fluid and doesn't behave in the same way. If I had time between ragechat and working for a living I'd make a better one, but I suppose it will do for a quick fix if you really needed this.
I can detect nudity without javascript 100% of the time.
From the comments, [this](http://www.silenzio.fr/#/en/movies/grid) I found to be a lot more impressive.
You are most welcome. If you are at all like myself, you will come to cherish this book for decades. Some of the appendices are great reads too. The one discussing "modern" computer graphics hardware is humorously out-of-date but it actually works quite well as a introduction to the history of dedicated computer graphics hardware (did you ever wonder just what kind of crazy research Silicon Graphics was up do before they bankrupted themselves?)
Runs fine and initializes instantly under Fx4 on Linux for me. For more *fun*, run this in a console after it's up and running: function createRandom(x,y) { if (Math.random() &gt; 0.5) { createBox(world, x, y, 10, 10, false); } else { createBall(world, x, y); } } Event.observe('canvas','mousedown',function(e){ createRandom(e.clientX, e.clientY); Event.observe('canvas', 'mousemove', function(e) { createRandom(e.clientX, e.clientY); }) }); Event.observe('canvas','mouseup',function(e){ Event.stopObserving('canvas', 'mousemove'); });
That's flash.
Yup, the rotation doesn't look right. Seems like it's just an default transition between the two shapes.
Nice. Anyone else got any other ways to make a bigger mess of this demo?
Didn't realize that, not nearly as impressive now, but still cool.
This is the stuff I hate about HTML, regardless of version. Browsers, not the standard, dictate how developers must create. I'm not bashing on Firefox since technically they are doing the right thing here. Its just that HTML5 seems to be adding a bunch of cool features, but does nothing to ease the misery of dealing with cross-browser compatibility.
Interestingly the top of the E doesn't seem to respond as you might expect - drop something on the right edge and the top doesn't spin off or anything; it just stays there fixed. I can't seem to destroy the E
Haha, I mentioned in the full text of the article (I know, its a long guide) that I couldn't bend the laws of physics to create an "E" without either making the top part fixed or using another box to keep it standing. I opted for the former. If I had the extra time, though, there's probably a way to move the center of gravity for the top part of the "E" so that it sits over the left side of the "E" making it stand on its own. This would, however, make it fall and react with respect to that new center of gravity.
that's because it's rotating on the wrong axis.
Sorry I gave up on the article and didn't run into that; I just skimmed. Thanks for making what should have been obvious to me obvious ;O) - it makes perfect sense that the top of the E couldn't work with normal gravity. I noticed that the cross bar of the "H" has a bit of bounce to it. Can you give the top of the "E" some bounce so that when it bounces it may knock itself off kilter? 
If I had more time to spend on it I could make the top of the "E" un-fixed once it gets hit by another body, but for now that top part ain't gonna budge no matter what.
Oh. That's a shame. It was done using Prototype? I had my fingers crossed it was jQuery.
The library itself uses prototype, but there's nothing to stop you from using JQuery along side it. Just be sure to use JQuery.noConflict() so you don't get the very vague "element.dispatchEvent() is not a function" error.
Headline stupid?
understandable
It should gracefully degrade if CSS3 is not available. How would I use this on a live website?
working great in chrome, very cool!
I'm Ron Burgundy?
should be: var linkText = '&lt;a href="javascript:void(0);" onmousedown="brMenu(\''+ID +'\');"&gt;';
Thanks, I think I could see a use for this now. I don't really need jQuery to set up a world stage. Got it! Cheers.
duh! Thanks a million!
I really don't like the layout, colors, or fact that he calls himself a "User Interface Ninja" when, personally, I feel the UI for the website is crap.
&gt;If you're willing to put up with this verbosity, in return however, your app will compile to smaller than the size of jQuery itself. In particular, after compilation, Closure knows to rename goog.dom.getElementById to something like 'A'. :) Care to elaborate?
See, it's not actually rotating around any axis because the plugin doesn't actually have a 3D representation of the scene. The slots where the images sit in are defined by CSS transform parameters and when changing the positions, a standard jquery animate call is used. The default one just smoothly transitions the CSS properties of the element into the new state, as opposed to simulate the movement of a solid sheet in 3D. Take a look at the [source](https://github.com/addyosmani/jqueryui-coverflow-ii), it's actually only mere half of the size of the blog post…
YUI and WRO4J have worked wonders. We implemented this in an ANT buildscript on our java web application. WRO4J concatenates javascript files (from both the local site and external sites - eg: google analytics) into solid blocks of javascript. YUI minifies everything, and does a very good job of it without altering your code as google closure might do. Never use a javascript compressor, they can slow down your page as the javascript has to decompress itself at load time. Do use gzip compression on the server, that is the best way to go. I also use Fiddler with a custom script I wrote to allow loading of source files in place of the WRO4J+YUI concatenated/minified files. This made coding/debugging with this type of system easier, because fiddler would read the WRO.xml file and load the source files I was working on instead of the concatenated/minified javascript. We had over 1MB of javascript source in about 20 different source files, in addition to lots of external libraries. Load times improved greatly because of the concatenated scripts loaded in a single server call, rather than 20 http round-trips. Everything was minified and gzipped. It doesn't really get any better than this. 
What does dostuff do? Unless it also defers part of the processing via setTimeout it's also going to execute synchronously. Even so in that case, it presumably also knows when it finishes, so you could trigger whatever action should follow it. You also don't seem to grasp how setTimeout works - it takes a function and gets the event loop to call it back at some point in the future but from the perspective of the running code it returns immediately (and should really be something like "setTimeout(waitLocked, 200);") 
Although i love apple and bad ass javascript, this effect reeks a little of noob flash design. Apple is all about no excess if it does not add to user experience, I am amazed that this is included. EDIT: I am talking about the pixie dust effect.
I'd like to throw out some thoughts right quick. 1. setTimeout doesn't pause anything. The JavaScript timing functions allow your script to keep executing while it waits for the timeout to expire. 2. using setTimeout in this way can end you up with an error like "RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded." You might consider [setInterval()](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp) and then you can set the callback function to check if it should continue or not. If it should then clear the timeout otherwise you do not have to do anything. I'd try to work waitLocked like this. function waitLocked(intervalVar){ if (insertLocked == false || deleteLocked == false){ clearInterval(intervalVar); } } 3. Google, w3schools, [Mozilla Developer Center(JS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/javascript) Good luck. You might also want to checkout the [learn programming](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/) subreddit.
dostuff sends out an ajax command.... You called it - I didn't understand what setTimeout does.....I setup a daisy chain to do the actions that I needed. Code is a bit longer but it definitely works.
Thanks for the top on clearInterval, I see how this is better.
Crushes my CPU...
Unless you are using web workers, there is no concurrency in JavaScript. Pre web workers, JavaScript has one thread that everything is executed in. setTimeout/Interval just ques up a function to run once the defined time interval has passed *and* the thread is free. Being asynchronous isn't the same as being concurrent (read more: http://ejohn.org/blog/how-javascript-timers-work/) If dostuff() is performing an AJAX request, you should pass a function as the second argument as a callback for that request to execute once it has completed. This is a pretty standard way to do things in JavaScript. function graphMove(direction) { dostuff(direction, function() { alert("do more stuff now that dostuff() is done"); }); }
MobileMe has been like that for a while. It's so slow its not funny at all. Email is even worse (the main function) its so unreliable and slow, I am stuck with it now I was such a sucker. Gmail functionality aside, and being free, its fast and reliable as hell.
I highly recommend StackOverflow for programming questions. If you want to get more people to see the question, feel free to link to it from reddit.
Umm, Wildebeest is in third place: jQote, Eco, **Wildebeest**, Haml-js, Resig, Underscore, Jade, Mustache, JUP. It isn't the best but it certainly isn't one of the slowest. (it's also &lt;1k minified with zero dependencies, which is nice)
Oh god... it's starting again... in 8 more months you'll have to click "skip this intro". I thought those dark days were behind us people. Yea it starts with a marquee tag, then a blink, next thing you know hidden HTML 5 elements will blast sound at you from hidden iframes, animated gifs of pick axes, hard hats, and glitter covered unicorns will thinly mask canvases of dancing chip chunks. Then you'll get the call, a friend needs help... they need... "a cool intro for their super awesome one of a kind idea site that you can't really know about because someone will surely slurp up their idea to sell used dog toys due to a down turn in the economy, and no it's better than ebay!". Sorry... think I just had a really bad Nam flashback.
&gt; There’s an interesting optimization feature in JavaScript which doesn’t necessarily apply in other languages. Every language I've ever worked with has this feature (Python, C, C++, Java, Ruby). Still a good tip though. Actually, Python and JavaScript have another cool feature with their and/or operators: If x is a "truthy" value (anything other than 0, false, null, NaN, `''` or undefined) then `x || y` returns x. If x is falsy, then `x || y` returns y. Similarly, `x &amp;&amp; y` returns y if x is truthy, and returns x if x is falsy.
The effects control code isn't CPU intensive... but the bloody alpha blending and scaling, and other graphical effects are done really inefficiently. Hardware accelerated browsers will REALLY improve this experience, as the graphics here is the bottleneck. Yeah....... 60% CPU on IE 9! But the animation is smooth, and there's no lags.
&gt; Actually, Python and JavaScript have another cool feature Perl, too. BTW, the constructs the OP refers to are known as "short-circuiting boolean operators" if anyone is looking for a label to put on it. 
That is one large button... 
.concat(), i = i.concat("foo"); is pretty handy for constructing long(er) strings... its also more efficient than using the + operator with strings. ( + is okay a bit ), but if your gonna be doing a lot of that: recommended.
Never use w3schools for anything. Lies, outdated information, and they tend to recommend the worst possible practice in any situation.
Im glad someone else was thinking the exact same thing.
Im asking an honest question: is there any practical reason to learn node.js, other than if you already have a strong js background? Why would I choose a little known tech over something stable and established?
thank you. very helpful :)
it has been submitted a few times until now
I like it!
This should probably be a link to https://github.com/jaysalvat/jquery.facedetection
Never heard of that, but considering Apple are claiming they're the sole inventors of HTML5 and CSS3, I'm not surprised. And the worst thing about it is that mac users actually believe this crap.
Wait, so you're saying CSS3 isn't part of HTML5 and only available on the iPad? /s The context of the article isn't important, it wasn't from Apple themselves, and there is actually a W3C draft on it, but I never heard anyone refer to this "Ajax 2" before.
This looks cool, but I dont buy the authors example of why RDB are bad
Care to elaborate? What's the problem with 4g? The [difference is, somewhat, clearly stated in the spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest2/#differences). You did search at least, right? Mozilla added the [FormData](http://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/05/formdata-interface-coming-to-firefox/) part earlier this year. [Progress events seem to be from some Web API spec](https://developer.mozilla.org/En/XMLHttpRequest/Using_XMLHttpRequest#Monitoring_progress) that I can't find by a quick google.
I can't recommend jqgrid, it tries to do too many things and fails at many of them. With 50+ options and 30+ methods, it's simply too bloated. I encountered weird bugs when I tried to initialize a jqGrid on a non-visible jQuery UI tab or when I added the JSON data on my own using addRowData. The jqGrid loader requires you to specify its directory path directly in the js file, which causes often overlooked script errors after updates. In your situation I would prefer a slimmer grid control that can be extended by plugins and is themeable using jquery UI. Datatables doesn't look bad to me, SlickGrid seems the right choice for heavy-duty tasks
I think I've also heard the term "lazy evaluation"
Why are you inlining javascript into your html written in javascript?
He mostly corrects it in his github repo by calling it an "object mapper", but my OCD must point out: You can't have an "ORM" (you know, object-*relational* mapper) backed by a non-relational database because there's no "relations" to "map" your "object" to. In fact, in the case of document-oriented storage engines like CouchDB and MongoDB, there's no need for "mapping" at all. Just being pedantic about the name, that's all.
Was playing with web workers this weekend. Pretty slick stuff, sadly no IE support though (even in IE9 beta).
Because it's really frickin' cool. I would think of it not so much as 'learning new tech' as 'being set free from old tech'. Unless by 'something stable and established' you are talking about Event Machine / etc. in which case I cannot comment. What's your preferred tech stack if I may ask?
Thanks. Still can't grasp the connotation between "4G" and "AJAX2". 4G, an "umbrella" for a group of semi-related technologies, is more closely related to console generations. AJAX, on the other hand, is *today* the "cool buzzword" version of the, not so aptly named, XMLHttpRequest API. Telia's LTE solution, which is what I think of when I hear "4G", has got a good verdict last I heard someone talk about it. Not that I think it really matters, this is /r/JS not /r/Telco.
Just to be clear, that's not a deficiency in Web Workers but a deficiency in IE. File a bug, I'd be interested to see what they say?
Word.
Their last release was 14 months ago. In the meantime jQuery has released 5 versions including jQuery 1.4. Never going back to Prototype.
Wow. Can you recommend an alternative?
It's only been tested on the models I've made with blender so far so i'm not sure about robustness and can't handle polygons above quads quite yet but so far it's a good proof of concept. Notes: all the processing is done client side like most of my projects and to load a new model refresh the page.To clear the current model I think it may just append the models if you didn't refresh but I'm not sure EDIT: I should also say that the model is from: http://e2-productions.com/repository/modules/PDdownloads/singlefile.php?cid=1&amp;lid=12 . EDIT2: Also there is a lot of incorrect clipping e.g. around the thighs since my z-sorting algorithm is very simple. It is what I intend to do next before I make it handle scene graphs.
So your idea of what makes a better library is total number of releases? Most of what's in those those releases are bugfixes and optimizations that finally brought jQuery up to the same level of performance as Prototype. jQuery 1.4 added a ton of extra _convenience_ functions to the continually bloating $ namespace, AJAX features that have been in Prototype for years, and a few more speed boosts that managed to get it to eek slightly ahead of Prototype in speed, which has now been nullified with Prototype 1.7's switching over to sizzle. There's no reason for Prototype to be putting out tons of releases, there's very few things they need to add that haven't already been handled by third party extensions. In fact the one big change they need to make is switching over to a wrapper system instead of extending the DOM, which is exactly what Prototype 2.0 is being written to do. I'm pleased with this 1.7 release. I probably wont use the new on() function, since I prefer writing my own event delegations, but the new layout functions could be a big help in my layout manager library.
Nice, I love prototype!
I'm impressed.
The most useful feature of jQuery, imho, are the live bindings. I can't consider switching until Prototype has an equivalent.
&gt;In fact the one big change they need to make is switching over to a wrapper system instead of extending the DOM, which is exactly what Prototype 2.0 is being written to do. I hate Prototype with a passion for that very reason. I also f-ing hate it because it modifies built-in objects. E.g. some versions overwrote `unshift` with a broken version, which in turn broke my perfectly fine code as soon as that bloody lib was present.
Well not to mention Prototype is a lot harder to understand and their syntax is definitely not as easy to use as jQuery. I also think it's important to see activity going around a javascript library. If I don't see any releases, as a developer I may think the project is slowly being abandoned.
Event delegation? http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=prototype+event+delegation&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8
I'm the only person in the world to feels that jQuery's api is very confusing and makes writing larger applications difficult. I definitely prefer Prototype's syntax to jQuery's. To me, jquery tries way too hard for a fluid interface. 
I was already pretty well versed with JS by the time I started using Prototype, so I actually find their syntax much more natural. jQuery feels like they try to shove everything inside the same box, which leads to naming schemes that follow little to no convention, and since everything is on the root object it's a clusterfuck to find the function you want to use. I also think Prototype's online reference is leaps and bounds above jQuery's for usability.
That's exactly what the on() function added in 1.7. the optional second argument allows you to specify a css selector for the element you want to bind against. However, event delegation has been possible in Prototype for years prior to this. Event.observe(document, 'click', function (event) { var element = event.element(); if (element.match('your&gt;selector.here')) { doshit(); } });
Ohhhh thanks! I'm going to have a tinker!
How the hell does this shit get 13 comments? First of all: it's like, 2 minutes of thought to write this - why would anyone need a tutorial? Second the RNG clearly isn't good enough because the noise repeats, Thirdly why would you do this? Fourthly what the hell is this `if ( !!!document.createElement('canvas').getContext ) {`??? Fifthly you suck. edit: actually #2 isn't accurate; the image is set to 55px square, so it repeats by design. Which is probably even worse. At least using an image you can ensure it tiles nicely. I still think the RNG probably isn't up to the job though. But I'd have to test that out. edit2: sorry about my tone, I know it's not nice to bite the newbies, but I just would rather this was presented as "Here's a silly little script I wrote to play about in canvas" rather than "Here's a tutorial that you can learn from". The former is perfectly fine, the latter... people are going to read this and think this is the right way to do things. That's really bad for the web.
Awesome! Thanks for shearing. =)
Thank you for the links. The project has been more of an introduction to 3d rendering for me, I thought that by writing my own engine and creating something with it I would have a greater understanding of how graphics are handled. So far everything aside from JSON and Sylvester (the matrix maths library) I have written myself and I have tried to derive as much as possible from first principles falling back to wikipedia to find out how it is done properly when I can't think of a method.
&gt;Fourthly what the hell is this if ( !!!document.createElement('canvas').getContext ) {??? I was all wtf when i saw that too. Here I fixed it. Change it to: if ( !!!!!!!!!document.createElement('canvas').getContext ) { return !!!!!!false; } 
Best I can get on that game is 24/25!
I'm stuck on 25 for a long time too... I think my best is 21/25 EDIT: 24/25 so close... EDIT2: [Success](http://i.imgur.com/SmKDZ.png)!
I can dig that.
I've got 24/45 three times now.
equally helpful would be a method on object like Object.setPrototype or somesuch Edit: see Object.create(null)
This is pretty awesome.
The live bindings in jquery bind to new elements as they are added to the DOM, if they match the selector. I don't know if prototype added that or not, but event delegation isn't what he's talking about.
I've used both Prototype and jquery fairly extensively. Prototype is much better for raw javascript code, but jquery is much more fluid for doing DOM manipulation, IMO. I also preferred Scriptaculous to jquery for animations, drag-drop, etc, but jquery is making some headway there.
I just google'd "jquery live binding" to see if we're talking about something else, and every hit was about [jQuery.live()](http://api.jquery.com/live/). Did you mean something else? I assure you .live() __is__ event delegation. It even says so in their documentation. There is one fundamental difference between jQuery and Prototype's approach, however. jQuery.live() puts the event handler on the body, whereas Prototype puts it on whatever parent element you tell it to put it. Prototype's method avoids a lot of unnecessary event handling. I sure hope you're wrong, because adding a new binding to an element whenever it's attached to the dom would be _really stupid_. It's the whole reason event delegation was invented.
\__proto__ is a non-standard extension and has been part of Mozilla's JS implementation for as long as I can remember. You probably shouldn't use it for cross-browser work.
It works in v8 and JavascriptCore, as well. I don't know about others.
Yeah, sorry, I was on my stupid pills this morning. Downvoted myself.
`fillStyle`/`fillRect` for every pixel, really? `createImageData`/`putImageData` is a lot quicker (and less silly).
Well v8 is the JavaScript engine for Chrome, so this isn't terribly surprising. Why do you think it would be very handy?
If you like the game demo, there's a much better version [here](http://www.yvoschaap.com/chainrxn/)
whew, i thought this was going to be Ruby-style parens-free function calls, which i dislike quite a bit. parens-free heads, though, i can get behind.
well you could finally use `for...in` safely Object.prototype.oops = "bar"; my_dictionary = { "key" : "value" }; for (var k in my_dictionary) console.log(k); //=&gt; key, oops var p = my_dictionary.__proto__; my_dictionary.__proto__ = null; for (var k in my_dictionary) console.log(k); //=&gt; key my_dictionary.__proto__ = p; 
It makes OO much easier.
&gt; whereas you can use coffeescript right now. Using a pre-processor is not ideal. I'm happy to see that the inventor of JavaScript still innovating around his core design.
the only thing getting rid of parentheses does is make javascript LESS readable. Parentheses and brackets are there for readability if nothing else, it helps keep your code organized. Getting rid of them only makes code harder to read. :(
you can use hasOwnProperty for this and does work cross-browser
I find Python extremely easy to read and all it doesn't have either.
Agreed. and point taken. However the syntax for this is much less clean than jQuery's approach. Defining your own wrapper which generates this code seems awkward. I can sprinkle live and die.calls wherever but creation and destruction seems much less intuitive and clean.
I think prototype's api is much more intuitive. For example jQuery's prev method takes either nothing or a css selector. If the previous element matches the css selector, it returns the element otherwise an empty jQuery object. Prototype will continue to look for previous elements which match that selector. Which makes way more sense to me. I think there are many other examples of this. It took me much longer to learn jQuery than prototype's style.
There's `Object.keys()` for you.
really i think the best thing about this is the ability to create a new root prototype
The parentheses and brackets are actually there because Eich's bosses at the time wanted javascript's syntax to look like C/Java, even though javascript itself doesn't have much else in common with that family of languages.
I've been trying this one out. http://labs.corefive.com/projects/filemanager/ Seems to work quite well, both stand alone and integrated with ckeditor. 
Here's another one I tried out about a year ago. Never tried it in combination with an editor but stand alone it worked well and it has multi-file uploads. http://www.ajaxplorer.info/wordpress/
I don't think a bytecode standard would make much difference. The time needed to compile javascript is negligible compared to the time needed to download the page.
It would make a hell of a difference if your code isn't in javascript and you can't/don't want to make a full conversion.
having opening and closing brackets makes things so much easier when using a text editor that can match them, so finding the end of a block of code is effortless, doesn't require any thought. When people leave out brackets from javascript (they are optional) it drives me crazy. Sometimes it really isn't that clear how the code is organized. Tabs are not the same on every text editor, and having the brackets in place makes it easy to navigate code. I've run into code that was not well organized that didnt have brackets and it takes so much longer to figure out, sometimes a very long time.. and it is a waste of time. Parentheses are not as important in many cases, though when organizing logical or arithmetic statements it can help a lot. Not everyone writes code the same way but having parentheses and brackets makes figuring out someone else's code much easier. It's about maintainability, not about catering to lazy people who think typing ( or { is too much effort. 
I know VIM can be configured to select blocks in Python despite the lack of brackets, and the use of significant whitespace makes everyone's code be formatted pretty much the same way.
You can look at this one, I heard about it but I haven't used it yet. [http://elrte.org/elfinder](http://elrte.org/elfinder)
&gt;The time needed to compile javascript [...] You'd still need to JIT compile it on the client side. What does change is that the fairly complicated parsing is replaced with more straightforward loading. However, the big idea is that outputting bytecode is easier (and more flexible) than outputting JavaScript. (I don't mind writing JavaScript though.)
try document.write(Number(foo) + Number(bar)) I'm not too familiar with prompt, but it most likely is returning the string "5". **edit** [There we go](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/window.prompt) &gt; result = window.prompt(text, value); &gt; result is a **string** containing the text entered by the user, or the value null.
The 5 you get from `promt` is a string. a) `foo = parseInt(prompt("foo"), 10);` b) `foo = +prompt("foo");` c) `document.write((+foo) + (+bar));`
Oh so prompt turns whatever you put in into a string unless told otherwise.
So the + in B and C is telling it to be an integer?
TIL you can do +"5" in js and get 5.
&gt;`document.write(Number(foo) + Number(bar))` Eh. Beh. You're using one of those pointless wrapper objects only to have its actual value pulled out again. The only thing you want is the conversion done by the constructor. You don't need an object for that. Don't use those wrappers ever. They are completely pointless.
Read up on dynamic typing: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Dynamic_typing (JavaScript is a dynamically typed language)
Since there is no string on either side of the plus, it must be addition, addition requires a number, hence it's converted to a number. If you want an integer you can either use `Math.round` (or `floor` or `ceil`) or the semi-awkward `~~` construct. &gt; Math.round('2.6') 3 &gt; ~~'2.6' 2 **Edit:** `~` is a bit op which inverts each bit. Doing it twice doesn't do anything, except if it wasn't an integer to begin with, in which case the fractions get truncated in the process (doing any bit op stuff with numbers will convert it to a 32bit int first).
There seem to be so many ways to do each thing.
I'd go with B, which is a shorter version of A. C looks weird and since you don't actually want to do anything with those inputs as strings, there is no need to store any strings. And ints... well, if you want truncation go with `~~` otherwise use `round`/`floor`/`ceil`.
There are translation tools that translate other languages into JS. Google writes some of their client side code in Java that is translated to JS so I guess it's pretty efficient.
ParseInt them puppies.
I know these tools and use them, but it's still a far cry from having a decent bytecode standard for which support could be comprehensive and reliable.
ParseFloat will decimate your puppies.
prompt() returns a string ya dingus! for your health.
var thisWillBeANumber = parseFloat(prompt("enter a number")); var thisWillBeAString = prompt("enter a number");
"24" * 1 returns the int 24. "twentyfour" * 1 returns NaN. I use this all the time to convert strings to numbers and be safe about it.
I wouldn't go with any of those options. When users enter bad data, they should be notified, and asked to correct their entries. This can be done by writing your own promptInt function which does data validation, etc, then returns a valid entry passed through parseInt. Don't do any of the +String, String * 1, or ~~String tricks. They are all nasty hacks relying on implicit casting, which is evil. If you use any of these hacks, you should comment the line with an explanation, which, frankly, would be more verbose than just using parseInt to begin with.
The best way is going to be the way that communicates what you are trying to do as clearly as possible without imposing an unacceptable performance hit. "Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live." parseInt() does what you're looking for and communicates what it's doing well. It might not be the fanciest vehicle but it's the most practical and it'll keep psychopaths from hunting you down and doing bad things to you and your family.
&gt; Eh. Beh. You're using one of those pointless wrapper objects only to have its actual value pulled out again. The only thing you want is the conversion done by the constructor. You don't need an object for that. Don't use those wrappers ever. They are completely pointless Number(foo) returns an actual number (it is different to using the 'new' operator). Eg. copy/paste this in your browser: javascript:alert(typeof Number('1')); // alerts 'number' as opposed to javascript:alert(typeof new Number('1')); // alerts 'object'
not everyone uses VIM, and not everyone programs in Python. We're talking about javascript here, but my assertion still stands - the use of parentheses and brackets is more maintainable than code that does not use them. I also code in Assembly and there brackets and parentheses are not used at all. I specify blocks of code differently there, but for javascript I can't see how not using them is better than using them. Nobody is maintaining my assembly code, it's only for my personal projects but even so it is still very well organized. Javascript on the other hand - i've worked on so many different projects and sloppy code is just painful to work on. Brackets and parentheses go a long way towards making it easier to deal with using any editor. I can't see how that can be disputed. 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs
For the truncated integer, use foo &gt;&gt; 0; or for the exact float/int value -(-foo);
Kinda like getting the current timestamp with +(new Date())
wtf there is no fork button anywhere on that page :/ fail
Now we can break things that try to do it the right way by using hasOwnProperty! Yaaaay! (crockford bitches about the possibility of hasOwnProperty being gone/replaced with a string/etc)
No... whenever you type something, you type *characters*. Before character '0' (digit zero) comes '/' (forward slash), and after character '9' (digit nine) comes the character ':' (colon). The set of character is imaginatively named a character set, and each character is mapped to a number (as computers can basically handle only numbers, everything else must be made of numbers), and that is it's encoding. In most encodings you will encounter, the digits 0-9 are mapped to code points 48-57. Hence when you type 55 into a box, you give the prompt box 2 characters (53, 53), which correspond to the string "55", and that is what the prompt function returns. On the other hand, Javascript as a language goes out of its way to convert numbers to convert values from strings to numbers and vice versa whenever there's a mismatch (with string having precedence).

:0 I love learning new things. 
 var _hop = ({}).hasOwnProperty; function has(obj,prop) { return _hop.call(obj,prop); }
What I think nog_lorp was saying is that you would break any code that tried to use hasOwnProperty (or any other object root method) on one of these alternately rooted objects. So other than creating objects that will crash in many javascript libraries, I'm not sure what the advantage would be. Ultimately this discussion is pretty moot as the _proto property is non-standard and afaik not supported in at least IE.
Don't use w3schols
Skeww and several other posters on this page are either just showing off or are the most embarrassingly terrible tutors I've ever run across. You're a beginner to Javascript. You don't want to be weighed down with obscure language syntax or theoretical discussions, which is what most commenters here seem to be trying to do. ## What you want to know is ## **Variables in Javascript can have different types** `5` is an integer (number), but "5" is a string *which just happens to be the character "five"*. **The + operator behaves differently depending on what you're adding with it.** Adding a number to a number adds the two numbers together, giving you another number. Adding a string to a string *concatenates* (joins) the strings together, giving you another string. Adding other types together (or adding one type to another, like adding a number to a string) give different results depending on the types involved, and which type you specify first. ## What you're trying to achieve ## As prompt() returns strings and you want to add them together as numbers, you need to convert them from strings to numbers and *then* add them together. The two main ways of converting strings to numbers are: `number_variable = parseInt(string_variable, base);` (Where `base` is the base of the number system you're using - almost always `10`). This will look at the string `string_variable` and take a best guess at extracting a number from it. Eg, if the user types in "123ty79 _7" then parseInt() will return the number `123`, ignoring everything after it. This is great if you want to take a best-guess at what the user meant, but sometimes it's better to just fail and throw an error message if the user doesn't provide *exactly* what you want, so they can check for themselves whether they typed what they actually meant to type. `number_variable = 0 + string_variable;` (or `number_variable = +string_variable;`) Here we're adding a number (`0`) to a string (remember the bit above, about adding two different types together?). Because the first part of the addition here is a number, the subsequent string value gets converted to a number too, so we're adding two numbers together, and the result (which ends up in `number_variable`) is a number, too. For obscure technical reasons you can get away with (and in fact it's slightly faster) writing just "+string_variable" instead of "0+string_variable" (but the reasons why are totally outside the scope of your question). This has the advantage that if the user types something that's **n**ot **a** **n**umber, the resulting value of the expression is a special javascript value called NaN (guess why! ;-). You can test for this situation by passing number_variable to the is_NaN() function (`is_NaN(number_variable)`) - if the value of a variable is NaN then this function will return true, or if the value is a valid number then it'll return false. This allows you to keep asking the user for a number *until they give you a valid number*, instead of looking at what they entered and just taking a stab at what they probably meant to type. I hope that helps - it was a bit long, but you asked a fairly basic question and instead of answering it basically, people just seem to have taken it as a licence to confuse the shit out of you with irrelevant, pedantic dick-waving to show each other how smart they are, instead of simply *answering the question in a way you can understand*. &lt;:-) If you're still curious about anything or anything above didn't make sense, feel free to ask follow-up questions below. ;-)
People who you've asked a simple, beginner-level question of are waving their cocks around and pedantically lecturing you on obscure aspects of the language, instead of simply answering your question in a way you can easily understand. :-(
There's a fundamental difference between parseInt() (which takes a best guess at the numerical value if the value doesn't exactly represent a number) and type-conversion syntax like `+variable` or `variable*1` (which returns NaN if variable isn't a number). ParseInt() is dangerous because users may not be aware of errors they made entering data. `+variable` is perfectly acceptable Javascript, but may be slightly obscure to non-expert Javascript developers. Alternatively you can pass the whole variable through `Number()`, which is functionally equivalent to `+variable`, but more verbose. However, `parseInt()` is **not** merely an alternative to type-casting - parsing a numerical value from a string is *not* the same thing as converting a variable's type.
Nearly. More accurately `prompt()` *always returns a string*, and it's up to you to convert that to a number if you need it to be. ;-)
Upvoted for self-downvoting.
&gt;not everyone uses VIM Any decent text editor will support the same &gt;not everyone programs in Python I used an example of a programming language that doesn't use brackets, if the language you do use has brackets it's a moot point. You make strong points, I'm just trying to say that a lack of brackets does not necessarily impact maintainability and editability quite so badly. I do agree, however, that optional brackets are horrible. 
In bytecode, how would Function.toSource() work exactly?
If you call a constructor function and omit `new`, the `this` inside the constructor will be the global object instead of a freshly created object. You should never do that. It only works because the non-constructor context magically happens to perform the casting for you. So yes, it's fine in this case, but since it's not fine in any other case you shouldn't do this kind of thing because it looks like a mistake. Things which look like a mistake waste time each time the code is read. Avoid those constructs at all costs.
Use [MDC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference). (Hint just use google and search for: mdc &lt;whatever you want to know&gt;.)
`+new Date` is actually enough, but yea, that's pretty awful. The non hacky version is `(new Date()).getTime()`, by the way. If you only care about modern browsers you can also use `Date.now()`.
These aren't obscure aspects of this language. Just like that quirky truthy/falsy stuff. You need to know about this if you'd like to have some confidence in your own code or if you want to understand the code from other people.
That is precisely why I suggested preceding the explicit cast with explicit data validation.
True (and apologies for my rudeness concerning your posts), but you have to tailor people's answers to their level of understanding, or you just confuse them even more. In this example the OP didn't even really understand how there was a difference between strings and integers in Javascript, so going into too much detail regarding the theory of types and Javascript syntax won't really help them in the slightest, when all they need to know is "strings and integers are handled differently, and here's how to convert a string to an integer". Your answers were very in-depth and helpful to a moderately-experienced JS developer, but as explainations for the OP they were kind of like a kid asking "what does 'atom' mean" and answering with a page of detailed description invoking quantum theory and the interactions of quarks - totally accurate, but way more detailed than they realistically had a chance of understanding. &lt;:-)
But parseInt() *isn't* an explicit cast - it's *parsing and extracting* one type from another, even if you do some validation on the initial type first first. An *explicit* cast would be to use `Number(string_variable)` to convert from string to a number, not parseInt().
No, but doing a cast from string to integer in JavaScript does validation followed by a parseInt internally. The validation just handles the NaN case. But that's besides (my) point entirely. I'm just pointing out that: 1. Data entry errors could be explicitly handled, and that the handling should involve notifying the user, and requiring the user to correct their input. 2. Syntax tricks like "~~ String" or "+ String" are easy for maintainers to miss, and therefore should be commented. And that I would furthermore put "String * 1", and most other implicit cast situations in this category. These are basic programming best practices, and not arguments about JavaScript internals. My suggestion to use parseInt, was as opposed to the implicit methods I list in point two above, not as opposed to Number(...), which is also explicit, and perfectly fine in my book.
Well, I learned JavaScript recently and I started with odd stuff at the very beginning (Crockford's talks and JavaScript: The Good Parts). Worked out surprisingly well, I'd say.
My entry: e=Math.PI*2;d=['beginPath','closePath','moveTo','lineTo','stroke'];setInterval(function(){i=Math;o=i.cos;n=i.sin;f=-(e/4);g=(e/60);j=(e/12);a.clearRect(0,0,200,200);s=new Date().getTime()/1000;m=(s/60)%60;h=(s/60/60)%12;s=s%60;a.lineWidth=9;a[d[0]]();a.arc(80,80,60,f+g*s,f,true);a[d[2]](80+o(f+g*m)*50,80+n(f+g*m)*50);a.arc(80,80,50,f+g*m,f,false);a[d[2]](80+o(f+j*h)*40,80+n(f+j*h)*40);a.arc(80,80,40,f+j*h,f,true);a[d[4]]();},1); 433 characters long :P Edited: Actually works now.

Slightly broken (jumpy/inaccurate arcs) and lacking the necessary Christmas theme, otherwise very nifty. :) For the lazy: it is a polar clock.
doesn't look jumpy to me, http://www.robinduckett.com/clock.html it's christmas themed in the way that it's almost christmas!
heh, I'm pretty sure he won't consider it christmas-y enough. Color the rings red and green, draw a rudimentary christmas tree under it to make the clock the tree topper. If space permits make it do something special on xmas day. The jerkiness I would guess is a math or js Date() issue. Sporadically the hour/minute rings will gain or lose an increment for a single cycle.
Potentially really cool, except I can't get your example images/canvases to render in FF 4, Opera 11 or IE9. No obvious JS errors either. edit: oh, you're using Workers, obviously it won't work in IE9.
I feel like it's a really really simple and dumbed down version of [ProcessingJS](http://processingjs.org/)
"2. jQuery Inline Validation: ...It’s very easy to use and I’d use it just for forms that doesn’t require too much security, because it’s insecure to validate a form with a script on client side." **SERVER SIDE VALIDATION MUST ALWAYS BE IN PLACE**. Client side validation is for the convenience of the user. Having both often duplicates effort to some degree, so server side first and always, client side most of the time but secondary, that is where all client side validation libraries fit in.
Jqtransform is a dog performance wise.
Why not? I've always found it a useful reference.
Nicholas C. Zakas also wrote a CSS parser recently, by the way: https://github.com/nzakas/parser-lib Stoyan Stefanov's should be faster and use less resources though.
Maybe a dumb question, but what the heck is this for?
As he put it: &gt;I have ideas for a bunch of CSS related tools and utilities, all of which, naturally, require understanding of CSS code. So I need a parser and thought I should write one in JavaScript. Same thing goes for me. Except that I'm too lazy and too stupid to write my own parser. :)
There's also [JSCSSP](http://glazman.org/JSCSSP/), which is used by [BlueGriffon](http://bluegriffon.org/).
The Number (and String) functions are actually functions, not constructor functions. You should never use them with new. http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_Number.asp https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Guide/Functions#Number_and_String_Functions
Well, I never use them either way.

Forcing focus on an element can be a bad idea. Someone using keyboard navigation for accessibility reasons would be very frustrated when they can't tab to the next element. That being said, I have found a good method for keeping track of focus is putting mousedown and keyup events on the body and checking event.target.
This has the potential to be really awesome, but I had to force quit it in Safari 5.0.1 on the latest Macbook Pro...

http://pastebin.com/HiUcWmLG The script changes the color of cells in a spreadsheet. If column c has text, and column H doesn't, then let column H be "yellow". Otherwise let column H be "lightgray" It works great. I want to use this as a base to write another script though. I need this: If column H has text, then column G needs to be the color "Salmon". If column H doesn't have text then column G needs to be "Lightgray". 
I known that usually it's a bad idea, but I'm using it with a validation system, to force the user to input correct data on specifics places. And by this way it's working really great for my needs. Thanks for commenting

AFAIK there is no Array type. Arrays are types of objects. EDIT: I meant to say, arrays inherit from objects, but when using typeof, it does not return array. typeof [] == "object" And wtf is a wobbly? Also, using his .constructor method instead of typeof seems very hackish. Typeof works very well when doing checks for undefined, functions, strings, booleans. If you are expecting null, you can always test == null or simply if(foo). jQuery, fyi, is littered with typeof checks and only one .constructor check and no instanceof checks.
I wasted 10 minutes making an icon, hit what I thought would be the "generate" button and the canvas cleared. :(
javascript:pi=0;i=1;s=1;y=Number(prompt('iterations'));if(!isNaN(y)){for(a=0;a&lt;y;a++){pi+=(4/i)xs;i+=2;sx=-1;}alert('pi: '+pi);} Hmm apparently reddit strips out asterisks which causes this to throw an error. So I rewrote it using an 'x' instead if you want to test it out you will have to swap the x for an asterisk. 
Ouch! (click / copy link on the preview at bottom left to save!)
 javascript:pi=0;i=1;s=1;y=Number(prompt('iterations'));if(!isNaN(y)){for(a=0;a&lt;y;a++){pi+=(4/i)*s;i+=2;s*=-1;}alert('pi: '+pi);} prefix with four spaces, or wrap in backticks ;) See also: http://www.puremango.co.uk/2010/09/complete-list-of-js1k-tweet-sized-entries/
Oh thanks, still not good with the proper reddit syntax.
Also many of those wont work since you need to prefix javascript: at the beginning to make it a direct translation to a URL. Most don't have the space to allow that.
well no, and they also generally only work in the context of the shim page provided by the js1k contest, eg assuming document.body.elements[0] is a canvas etc. It was a 'see also' more than an 'already done'. My rot13 entry might interest you more though: javascript:for(r=o='rot13';o=prompt(r,o).replace(/[a-z]/gi,function(c){return String.fromCharCode((n=c.charCodeAt()+13)&gt;122||n&lt;104&amp;&amp;n&gt;90?n-26:n)});); With the javascript: prefix it still doesn't fit in the space requirement, but at least it runs.
You can save some space in the PI example (12 chars): javascript:p=0;i=s=1;y=0+prompt('iterations');if(!isNaN(y)){for(a=0;a&lt;y;a++,p+=(4/i)*s,i+=2,s*=-1,alert('pi: '+p));}
What, really? Array.prototype !== Object.prototype Arrays have numbed indexes, and when you loop over them they are ordered, they also have a _special_ length property. Arrays are a type of object though, so like any object you can set arbitrary properties on them. 
yes i understand arrays and objects are different, but what i was trying to say is there is no typeof array. [Crockford has his own way](http://javascript.crockford.com/remedial.html) of using typeof which properly tells us an array from an object: function typeOf(value) { var s = typeof value; if (s === 'object') { if (value) { if (typeof value.length === 'number' &amp;&amp; !(value.propertyIsEnumerable('length')) &amp;&amp; typeof value.splice === 'function') { s = 'array'; } } else { s = 'null'; } } return s; } 
My bad, I thought you were trying to say that arrays were the same as objects.
The bit that does it is the .propertyIsEnumerable check as although you can simulate an Array in a custom object you can't set the pIE value.
Good idea wrapping everything into the for loop. I missed that one.
The interesting/sad thing here is that even though the scripts download in parallel, this method still blocks page rendering. In other words, as far as the end user is concerned, a JS file that downloads slowly will stop the page from rendering for just as long as it would have before. The only method that is totally non-blocking is to use an XmlHttpRequest to download code and then eval it.
&gt;`y=0+prompt` You shouldn't put that '0' there. &gt;&gt;&gt; y=0+prompt('foo') //entered 4 "04" &gt;&gt;&gt; y=+prompt('foo') //entered 4 4 **Edit:** &gt;`(4/i)*s` Braces aren't required here. **Edit#2:** `javascript:p=0;i=s=1;y=+prompt('iterations');for(;y--;p+=4/i*s,i+=2,s*=-1);p&amp;&amp;alert('pi: '+p)` 93 chars (instead of 116). **Edit#3:** `javascript:for(p=0,i=s=1,y=+prompt('iterations');y--;p+=4/i*s,i+=2,s*=-1);p&amp;&amp;alert('pi: '+p)` 92 chars. :&gt;

Fancybox adds DIVs to the page with hard-coded IDs embedded, sure. Also, from a jQuery point of view, sure... you could just keep references to these elements in the jQuery code. However, fancybox also comes with CSS which is used to style it. If it didn't use a hardcoded ID (or class?), its CSS wouldn't have a reference-point from which to find it, in order to style it. Also, when has the naming scheme of having IDs such as "fancybox-wrap" / "fancybox-overlay" added to a page's DOM ever actually resulted in a namespace clash? Pretty rarely I'd guess. Sure they could add functionality to allow you to choose ID names but this would mean I'd have to go and edit the CSS to make sure that the styles can find the relevant elements, so... personally I'm happy with the hard-coded compromise.
Using a classname instead of an ID wouldn't be a problem. A classname doesn't have to be unique within the DOM. An ID has to. An ID shouldn't have a semantic purpose. A plugin should be as less invasive as possible - to ease reuse and increase applicability. With an ID bound strategy, a plugin completely eliminates the possibility to be used twice on a page. And when using CSS without any constraints on the available page, use mySheet.insertRule/addRule (gecko/IE) and inject the static css from within JavaScript. Makes customizability way easier, or templating. 
&gt; use mySheet.insertRule/addRule Where do the rules come from? Are they embedded inside the JS? 
Yeah, but it's not necessary to embedded ALL rules within JS, but the "head-class" rule and some basic color codes that all other rules are derived from.
I agree. Ryan's style is both subtle and engaging.

Someone posted a link to a page with a demo of this a few days ago, and the conclusion was that it's terrible.
I've had to do exactly what you're describing many many times. First and foremost, what server side technology are you using? It's best to start from the assumption that there is going to be no client side validation. There needs to be a server side system in place that can validate a business model and return an array of error messages if something is wrong. Sine the server side validation must be in place to ensure accuracy anyway, your forms should never be able to save unless they're in a valid state so, keep in mind that anything beyond that is simply for the benefit of the user. Some server side frameworks can actually help out with some of the client validation. Now for client side. I would suggest you try to separate the different areas of concern: * Data Error Validation: At this point don't worry about showing/hiding, enabling/disabling, stopping key strokes or setting focus, just make sure that values are within the allowed range, ints are ints, floats are floats, dates are dates (use a calendar control if you can, I suggest jQuery UI but also validate the input field), strings aren't longer than they are allowed to be and regular expressions for everything else. I suggest using the jQuery Validate plugin for this. I would also suggest not attempting to stop key strokes, it's unnecessary, annoying to the user and there are a whole lot of things to think about when doing it, such as stopping pasting while allowing copying, allowing arrow keys, only 1 '.' in decimal fields, backspace, delete, etc. A message next to the input on blur or a validation summary when attempting to submit is enough for any user to figure out what's going on and jQuery Validate does it for you. The plugin is very simple to use, you just add classes to the input field e.g. class='required digits' will make the field required and allow only digits (no decimals), if it's invalid it will add the 'error' class to the input and the error message lable so you can easily style them to give the user visual feed back that something is wrong. * Conditional Validation: jQuery Validate can also handle this quite well. It allows custom validation functions, you could make some generic functions such as requiredIf(someOtherInput, values) that returns true if some other input has a certain value or any of a list of values, or something like emptyIf(someOtherInput, values) that ensures a certin input is left empty if it is not supposed to be answer in the current context. * Showing/Hiding: It's been my experience that, even on very long forms, showing/hiding small blocks of questions, such as follow up questions i.e. 'If yes, then...', if very jarring to the user, enabling/disabling is less jarring but you have to ensure you clear things out if they previously filled it out then changed their mind on the answer that disables the field. If your form is broken up into sections, I have found users like collapable sections as opposed to tabs as you can have multiple sections open in case they need to reference different sections at the same time. During submitt, if there are any errors, it's nice for the user if you look for any input fields with the 'error' class, check to see if the section the error is in is visible, and if it's not, expand the collapsed section automatically. You can make expandable sections yourself in jQuery pretty easily, don't attempt to user the jQuery UI Accordian plugin, that will only allow one section open at a time and defeates the purpose. * Warning system: I think you're sort of on your own on this one if you in fact mean what I think you mean. If you mean something like this number field can be between 1 and 10 but its very unlikely to be above a 6 so you want to warn them, perhapse even make them confirm their answer, then you'll have to come up with a system for marking answers as 'confirmed'. If you simply mean you just want to tell them a little bit about the field then I think a small note next to it would suffice. As a side note, I suggest avoiding radio buttons and checkboxes if you can and use drop downs instead, even for Yes/No questions, ESPECIALLY if you or the user needs to blank out the field under certain conditions. Radio buttons and checkboxes are a major pain to work with, especially across multiple browsers. EDIT: I forgot to mention this comes from years of experience dealing with customers insisting that they want all the crazy showing/hiding, enabling/disabling, stopping key strokes, etc. when they don't realize all they really want is their data to be in a valid state which has nothing to do with the user experience for the person filling in the form and everything to do with solid server side model validation.

You failed to read. &gt;This framework is there to help you creates animations and games using sprites in an efficient way. The goal is to have common framework for Desktop and mobile browsers. &gt;sprite.js is has been tested on Chromium, Firefox, Android emulator and Opera. &gt;For an example of the what the framework offers, have a look at test_sprites.html. &gt;You can see the demon online here: http://batiste.dosimple.ch/sprite.js/test_sprites.html
Actually, using classnames instead of ids would be a problem. There isn't any native, cross browser function to get any elements with a specific class. Basically, you have to loop through each element and see if it contains the class you're looking for. This ends up being very slow and expensive. document.getElementById on the other hand, is very fast and is supported in all browsers. Sure, it *could* work with classnames, but ids are much better for performance considerations. And specifically related to Fancybox, there really isn't any reason to have more than one on a page. Each time a different fancybox link is clicked, it loads up the static fancybox DOM elements, and passes the specific image to it. Plugins that work this way are better conceptualized as static or singleton classes rather than globals.
You are correct about using getElementById. Using IDs also has the benefit of letting you separate your code from your layout. the class property was initially intended for layout - styling an element using css in a style sheet - IDs can be used for this as well, but their primary purpose (before CSS was invented) is to address a specific element in the DOM. It's only because of jQuery that people use class names to target DOM elements, which is a very bad way of using the DOM since it has not had any native methods for doing this until recently. If performance is important to you, do not use class names as a way to address DOM elements. 
I was just going to write this...the id naming scheme they use is guaranteed not to ever clash with something you write as a dev. I love fancybox and it's a shame the writer is trying to rag on them for something as silly as this.
Looks pretty handy to me... esp if your not using the canvas or HTML5 only stuff.. cant see anything that id optimise. Could use with web demo, as in demoscene type stuff or games that need to work on old browsers etc
 http://batiste.dosimple.ch/sprite.js/test_sprites.html
I have worked with canvas and experienced very bad performances even for simpler stuff than that, especially on mobile devices. But I think about making a canvas backend to the framework so It would be very easy to switch.
Why would you need to getElementById to a DOM element that you created. That's what's wrong in the first place - just keep the pointer jQuery returned to you. 
How are the other rules defined? In static CSS and referencing just a class name? (e.g. .caption {font-size: 90%;}?)
It isn't called "cascading" for nothing. I don't have a problem with using static Classnames - as they don't break reusability within a framework. IDs do. When you design a plugin, make it pluggable. So: don't make assumptions if you'll be a singleton or what. If you do, than design right. Other jQuery plugins break, as soon as you invoke jQuery.noConflict. jQuery itself is very well designed - as from an architectural point of view. A plugin should strictly adhere to these standards or it shouldn't be called a plugin. 
Animating elements along paths used to be atrociously slow, your sprite performance is pretty good.. We are blessed these days with WebGL and Canvas :) its moved a long way,, long let it continue :)
I think it's really problematic, when plugins to a very good designed framework don't adhere to the same design principles or code quality. With sloppy programmed plugins, you can not only ruin your day, but also ruin the impression a framework makes. As noted further down the chain: if your plugin breaks, when jQuery.noConflict() is invoked, it shouldn't be a plugin in the first place. Just some sloppy code that uses jQuery. If your plugin isn't reusable, it's not a plugin (= pluggable, least invasive), it's a full blown application. Well decorated or not - architecture and design do matter. 
Long Polling is a workaround used in cases where you would traditionally use a socket connection (such as chat, real-time game communication, etc), but can't due to the browser's lack of proper socket support. However, since web sockets exist in the newest major browsers, you should be using them when available, flash-based sockets when native sockets aren't available, and only then resorting to long polling. The socket.io library for node handles all of this without ever having to get your hands dirty. Check it out here: http://labs.learnboost.com/socket.io/ Edit: this also really belongs in /r/node

Why do you think cpanel has anything to do with it? In any case, get yourself a copy of chrome. While on your page, ctrl shift I to bring up developer tools. Click on the console tab, after loading. Check if there are errors there. Next, click on the scripts tab. Click the dropdown, and find the javascript that loads the tabs. Add a breakpoint (by clicking on the line number) and refresh the page. Now step through the script line by line to verify if it's running as it should. As a final check, click on the elements tab, click the magnifying glass, and click on the tabs. Now browse the classes, styles, etc...might give you some idea.
heh, for finding a substring: benchStringRegExSearch = function(count) { var seven = "12734", res, hasSeven = /7/; while (count--) res = seven.search(hasSeven)!==-1; }; Performed faster for me in FF 4.0b7 than using .test.
The problem with the string match tests is that res isn't the same in all of them: benchStringMatch assigns a match object, the other two (and your variant) are Boolean. I like the double-negated tilde operator for indexOf tests, don't know if it is faster than comparing absolutely with -1: benchStringIndexOfTilde = function(count) { var seven = "12734", res; while (count--) res = !!~seven.indexOf("7"); } Edit: D'oh! Should have read the comments in page first...
https://github.com/sebarmeli/JS-Redirection-Mobile-Site/blob/master/redirection_mobile.js line 132 you can change to: document.location.href = '/mobile_index.html';
Thanks to you I looked into "document.location.href" and learnt something new. Thank you very much. 
hum. can someone please enlighten me why not to just use jquery ui dialogs? they had nice closeable capabilities last time I looked ...
If you're using jQuery to normalize browser behavior: $(document).ready(function() { $('body').keypress(function(e) { switch(e.keyCode) { case '38': $('.selectorForUpButton').trigger('click'); break; // Fill in the rest using keycodes from http://www.cambiaresearch.com/c4/702b8cd1-e5b0-42e6-83ac-25f0306e3e25/Javascript-Char-Codes-Key-Codes.aspx } }); }); Not tested, just typed it up in here, but that should work.

does it need to trigger a click, or does it just need to run the same function? is there something special about that click? look into keypress events: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/keys.html you can go with jquery, but unless you're using it for other purposes you may as well be using a wrecking ball to crack open a walnut. 
Generally, non-printing keys (like backspace, tab, arrows) should be checked on *keydown*. Also, for the OP, the arrow keys on the number-pad have different keycodes from the dedicated arrows.
This. Their documentation is terrible.
where is the collision detection? seems like there is a lot missing in order to qualify this as a 'sprite' library. 
Well, would be nice if you see an image change on the screen, so you have feedback that the script work properly, because it would really suck if I discover that it doesnt work when i try to control my fridge. Then it will be hard to search the error, because I will also have to programm a lot of AVR's and stuff. 
I will try it this weekend. Thank is advance! You will hear from me!
If you use this technique on any page other than the home page, you'll become one of those annoying sites where you follow a link to a specific page and get redirected to the "mobile index". Then I have use a 400px keyboard to find my way back to what I was trying to read. Be careful with it.
