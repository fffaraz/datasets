Do you develop for a living? Because if you do, that attitude will kill your career. This doesn't mean that you should take every fancy new input you see, or even test them all (you don't have time to anyway) but never dismiss anything because it is a temporary hinderance to your productivity when it can give you a potential boost later. If you run with that attitude you will lock yourself into a temporary local maximum and you will get hit hard when the technology changes. 
I'm not advocating using it to access variables. I don't see why eval is worse than injecting an entire image with foreign javascript in the onLoad. It isn't safer, it isn't faster.
I don't mean to give you the wrong idea, because I don't think his solution is good at all. My solution to his problem would probably involve parsing a JSON formatted response, as opposed to an HTML fragment. I'd use a proper JSON parsing library.
Can you try to provide a few more details? What browser? What version? Is this a vanilla bookmarklet, or would a GreaseMonkey script or browser extension work? What do you mean by "takes"? (are these links on a page? are you inputting them into a prompt?) In terms of what you asked, try something like [this](http://jsfiddle.net/pf6Yz/). Depending on the browser, it may also have URL parsing functions, or you could use a library. Ditto with copying to the clipboard. Keep in mind that bookmarklets are being phased out by some browsers...also they run in the context of the page... bookmarklets are largely for when you want to **script a webpage**. Based on what you say here and elsewhere it sounds more like you want to **script the browser**...in which case you want something like an extension or perhaps GreaseMonkey.
I've added some matchers for Jasmine to the image diff utility. This makes it possible to unit test drawing functionality against stored images. It also makes regression testing against stable code possible. The toImageDiffEqual matcher accepts: Image, Canvas, CanvasRenderingContext2D and ImageData. Any thoughts or suggestions welcome!
Your comment won't help the OP construct a `\` in a string so they can split. It does help advertise PHP, but doesn't do much else.
At a glance, I'm not sure, but if you're measuring the thing and you know whether the window's wide enough, you can just set `overflow: hidden` on the DIV and get around it. By the way, you should "de-bounce" the `resize` event because otherwise it'll fire _really_ often. Some versions of IE fire it _twice_ each time you resize the window by even one pixel.
You want `parentNode` instead of `parent`. You also want (e.g.) `show('top')` instead of `show(top)`.
In your show function, would you need to do something like: document.getElementById("#" + divid).style.display = "block" Wasn't able to try this out at the moment to see if it fixes it.
You're thinking of selectors- in basic javascript, you wouldn't need to add that "#", as getElementById *knows* it's looking for an ID.
I do develop for a living and I can see your point, but I just don't see the benefit to it for somebody like me who has developed so long in JS. To a beginner it could be of great assistance but to me it just seems to be an extra layer between me the native browser interface. I've deliberately dodged alot of development paths in my career so far and for me staying native (to the browser) and avoiding extra layers of complexity have paid off in the long run. I'm not bagging people who want to use this, each to their own and good luck to anybody who wants to use coffeescript.
Ah ok thanks for the heads up, I would have tried it myself before posting, but, a couple servers went down today and im in the middle of repairing them. Thanks for the heads up!
So I now have this.parentNode.style.display = 'none'; And I've added single quotes in my `onclick=`'s. Still nothing seems to be happening.. Arghhh! I just can't seem to get the hang of this.
I tried it anyway, just incase something magic happened. It didn't work, and with my untrained eyes I still can't find anything wrong with this! My only question is if `this.` works from within a function?
 The 'this' keyword in your function represents the DOMWindow, not the link. You need to specifically pass that through in your function call. Also, you need to put quotes around your DIV names as they're references to DOM elements, not objects/variables. like so: &lt;script language="javascript" type="text/javascript"&gt; function show( divid , obj ){ obj.parentNode.style.display = 'none'; document.getElementById( divid ).style.display = 'block' } &lt;/script&gt; &lt;div id="com"&gt; &lt;a onclick="show('top', this)" href="javascript:;" class="head"&gt;Comunications&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a onclick="show('email', this)" href="javascript:;" class="body"&gt;E-mail&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a onclick="show('social', this)" href="javascript:;" class="body"&gt;Social Networking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a onclick="show('im', this)" href="javascript:;" class="body"&gt;Instant Messaging&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a onclick="show('forum', this)" href="javascript:;" class="body"&gt;Forums&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
Sounds like a good idea. I think I'll do that, thanks! I still wish I knew why it failed. Thanks for the de-bouncing advice too. 
the problem in your code is 'this' in the function show() is referencing to the 'window' object. (I assume that you meant to get the div#com instead?) I've tried to guess your intention and came up with [http://jsfiddle.net/RzA3P/](http://jsfiddle.net/RzA3P/). Let me know if that answer your question. 
Yes! You sir are a javascript god, to me at the very least. It says so on RES. I had a feeling that it was `this` that wasn't working, thank you for explaining and being so helpful.
It takes a lot of arrogance to argue with the author of JSLint about stuff like this. To be fair, Crockford doesn't really make his point effectively, which I think is that because those are going to be hoisted automatically, you need to put them there to make sure you understand the consequences. But it's not like he needs to justify himself--it's his project.
I agree with the others here about how Node.js+socket.io would be the right tool for this kind of task. Perhaps [hookbox](http://labs.gameclosure.com/hookbox/) would be a simpler alternative, if you are short on time and/or not necessarily want to learn all that. It is a comet server designed to tightly integrates with your current stack (basically it just hooks events to your php files, hence the name). Might still be a bit in its infancy, but the available docs and examples will be enough to get you started. also check [this example](http://bitshaq.com/2010/07/30/a-simple-experiment-with-hookbox/). 
Not to be rude, but this is not what this subreddit is for.
And? What do you want to hear? That Crockford is a meany? He is right. Your code shouldn't suggest that it's doing A if it's actually doing B.
Man, there are a lot of people commenting there that don't get it. The whole point of the warning is to force you to confront the fact that Javascript does not have block level scoped variables, but only function level scope. In other languages, like C++, when you declare a variable inside a `for()`, its lifetime only consists of that loop's block. The variable does not exist before and after the block. In JS, that variable that you declared in a `for()` loop actually exists for the entire function, even before it was declared and after the for-loop's block has terminated. The language hoists that declaration to the beginning of the function, no matter where in the function you actually write it. This is often a source of confusion, because it's different than so many other languages, and therefore it leads to subtle errors. It's not easy at all to tell by inspection if the person who wrote that code really knew about the scoping rules or whether they made a mistake, so to avoid the ambiguity it should be avoided. If you declare your variables at the top of a function you are saying that you are explicitly clear about how scope works, and you are avoiding the possibility of making errors due to forgetting this quirk. Crockford's entire philosophy behind JSLint is to have a tool that prevents people from doing things that are legal but dubious; to write a subset of Javascript with all the sharp edges removed.
Github link to [Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) Otherwise your tldr is useless
Why on earth should I learn a scripting language that compiles into another scripting language. I certainly wouldn't learn Danish so that it could translated into Swedish...
So it does http://jsfiddle.net/4nzMB/ Downvote me into oblivion!
I wonder if what they really wanted was: If a variable is declared as part of a for(var x...) { } style loop and _only_ used in the loop... then it would be nice to be able to suppress the warning.
&lt;snark&gt;Like making comments on Reddit threads which don't contribute meaningfully to the discussion?&lt;/snark&gt;
http://www.jshint.com
WHY DOES MY _______? BECAUSE LEARN JAVASCRIPT.
Also, [here](http://www.quirksmode.org/js/this.html) is a guide to *this*. You were probably expecting functionality similar to: Element.prototype.show = function() { this.style.display = 'inherit' };
Oh, I'm not saying that you shouldn't be using it. I was just pointing out that I found it odd that I've never had a *reason* to use it and had therefore only considered it within the context of the body tag. 
Fair enough. Obviously it can cause issues though(as I have just found out).
&gt;It takes a lot of arrogance to argue with the author of JSLint about stuff like this. Argument from authority. &gt;To be fair, Crockford doesn't really make his point effectively I can only assume this is why OP posted this. The point isn't that he's not philosophically right, the point is that he's being a complete dick about it.
&gt;Javascript does not have block level scoped variables `let` will change that, by the way.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority Not all appeals to authority are fallacious. Read up.
Remove the values in your href attribute as these are obviously trash. Instead either leave that value as an empty string or as a "#", which denotes an unspecified fragment to the current URI, which typically implies page top. You can disable this hyperlink ability of the anchor tag with this code: function show (divid) { this.parentNode.style.display = 'none'; document.getElementById(divid).style.display = 'block'; return false; }
I didn't say it was fallacious -- i'm just saying, it *is* an argument from authority. Be careful.
`| grep -v "Move 'var' declarations to the top of the function."` and shut the fuck up. It's plain, easily parseable text. This is why Unix exists.
Fair enough :)
It surprises me that JSLint seems to be so widely accepted, since it's obviously not really meant to be as useful as possible to developers, but rather to enforce Crockford's idiosyncratic decisions about coding style. Not that most of those choices are unreasonable, mind you, but making them unconfigurable checks in a lint-style program isn't the way to go. edit: Lol, the [next issue](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSLint/pull/18) is a denied pull request for a patch for "for (var i=".
Crockford acknowledges this in the ticket, and says when `let` is mainstream he will modify jsLint to recommend never using `var`
Crockford would still respond the same, JavaScript does not have block level scoping, yet, only function level scoping.
If you want better discussion on *why* Crockford does thing it's better to ask on the [yahoo group](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/jslint_com/) than the bug tracker
No, they get it. You don't get _their_ point, though. If all of the rules of JSLint were so objective, then why are there options for disabling most of them, or altering the way they work? If there is only 1 "right" way to code, then why are there options? That's the paradox here: the philosophy and implementation do not match. It's this propensity of Crockford to stick to his pedantic ideals that ultimately is slowly eroding JSLint to the status of irrelevant. There's already alternatives and they don't force you to drink to kool-aid that goes with them.
Novel.
Basically what I was thinking, with the addition of the fact that you can also connect on different ports in the same manner, e.g.: &lt;img src="http://192.168.1.1:80" /&gt; Also, applications like NMAP have fingerprints for OS's/services/etc., that if ported to JS, could possibly be used to identify those devices. 
There's probably several files, but one would be the [ARP table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol). Actually, depending upon implementation, it's probably more likely to be solely in-memory. Regardless, this is not going to be a file that would be publicly accessible; you'd need to use something like DD-WRT to install a simple sever (or some other means) to act as a service by which you could request the ARP data.
yeah, he skipped the punchline. 
Any javascript developer worth his salt should be aware of hoisting, that being said I don't agree that all variables should be declared at the top. Readability affects reliability, despite what Crockford says in his comment. Having a 100+ line function with all the variables defined at the top would be troublesome especially if they are initialized to a value. The issue is further complicated by poor variable naming like 'i'.
&gt;even before it was declared how does that work? 
Overall I think this example is over-convoluted for little benefit. More importantly \_\_proto\_\_ is not supported by all browsers. For simple cases, something like this: function foo ( arg1 ) { arg1 = isValid( arg1 ) ? arg1 : default_value; } (where isValid is a function that makes sure arg1 is suitable) or: function foo ( arg1 ) { arg1 = arg1 || true; } ...should suffice. Though note, the latter method assumes you want truthy values to be valid and falsey values to be invalid...or that the only valid falsey value is the default... which is not always the case. For example, 0 might be a valid value but this would toss it and use the default. For more complicated functions, I would have it accept an object containing various options, and then use a function like the following: function setOptions( user_options ) { var option = null ,no_opt = null ,defaults = default_options ; for ( option in defaults ) { no_opt = defaults.hasOwnProperty( option ) &amp;&amp; !user_options.hasOwnProperty( option ); if ( no_opt ) { user_options[ option ] = defaults[ option ]; } } return user_options; } This will take the options object provided by the function and fill in any missing options from an object containing defaults. Another options is to use CoffeeScript which makes the whole thing much cleaner: foo = ( bar = "blah", buzz = "fizz" ) -&gt; console.log bar, buzz or foo = ( args = bar : "blah", buzz : "fizz" ) -&gt; console.log args.bar, args.buzz 
Agreed. Crockford, while smart, is blinded by his own ego. He makes hard rules and ignored pragmatism. An example is the following recommendation: for (var p in obj) { if(obj.hasOwnProperty(p)) { // do something } } Vs: for (var p in obj) { if(!obj.hasOwnProperty(p)) continue; // do something } The latter has the advantage that while being exactly the same in functionality, it does not increase the indention, and it lets you deal with the edge case all at once at the top of the block instead of having to keep it straight throughout the block. This is especially helpful if the block is long, or if there are several layers of indention already.
I have to admit, this is my first thought. Doesn't excuse the lack of configurability, though. edit: apparently, JSLint stops processing when it finds the error, so it causes you to miss other warnings.
What happens when you minify your code? It breaks.
The code is the same, and assuming that the reader knows that javascript doesn't have block level scope, the for(var x) is clearer about intent. If you re-use the variable in multiple places and forget to clear it which causes a side effect, the result is the same whether you declare it at the top or inline. The advantage of declaring it inline is that you'll get a more obvious warning saying that you've declared the same var twice, and the reader can more easily discern your intent to only use the variable within the block.
[citation needed] But since you can't provide one, I will. Not minified: http://jsfiddle.net/hfuEs/4/ Minified with closure compiler: http://jsfiddle.net/VwCCK/3/ Minified with uglifyJS: http://jsfiddle.net/VjsMv/1/ 
&gt;Man, there are a lot of people commenting there that don't get it. Right...I mean they say they get it, but obviously they don't. 'Cause if they understood the scoping rules, they couldn't *possibly* abide the thought of variable declarations anywhere but the beginning of their scope. Even just a transient "i" that's not used anywhere else. And never mind the fact that the standard allows declarations to be elsewhere. The standard obviously doesn't understand the scoping rules either. Lucky we have JSLint to correct all this ignorance. 
Let's say you did this: function foo() { // stuff ... var x = 1; ... } It actually works as though you did this: function foo() { var x; // stuff ... x = 1; ... } 
I'd like to use jslint, but if you have rules like this that can't be configured off it makes it too hard to integrate into an existing code base. If I start using a tool like this and the first run outputs 5 billion warnings, most of which can't be turned off, then I stop using the tool.
that means your minifier sucks
Maybe I'm biased coming from Python (that basically hoists its variables), but I have no problem figuring this out, and it hurts readability and locality of code to move `var` declarations away from where the variable is first used. Using a variable *before* its declaration would be worthy of a warning, but if you don't do so then it's actually demonstrably not harmful. I do use the Emacs' `js2-mode` which contains a bunch of good error checks, including double declaration of a variable. This sometimes annoys me, especially when technically I've declared it but it feels like a different scope. And I put up with that and hoist my own declaration, but only because I know js2-mode is *actually* looking out for me. Just generally I find Crockford's opinions to be pedantic and not particularly useful.
What happens if you put single quotes around the parameters? Like: show('top') Also: your "'this" is bunk. You'll better pass show(this, 'top') and treat the value of "this" as a normal parameter. In other words: don't use the keyword "this" in your function.
What the standard allows is completely irrelevant, because the standard allows for all kinds of nonsense that should never be used. The whole point of this program is not to tell you whether your code is legal or illegal according to the standard, but to tell you whether it follows Crockford's guidelines.
&gt;What the standard allows is completely irrelevant, because the standard allows for all kinds of nonsense that should never be used. You're missing the point of my response. You didn't just claim people were wrong: you concluded that they must be ignorant of the scoping rules. My point was that disagreeing with Crockford over declaration placement guidelines does not imply such ignorance. &gt;The whole point of this program is not to tell you whether your code is legal or illegal according to the standard, but to tell you whether it follows Crockford's guidelines. I completely agree that that's the point of JSLint, which is why I think it's misleadingly named, and why I'm surprised it's so widely used. 
What kind of insane linter quits after finding one warning?
Why do you think there would be different handling for future and past dates? It's all the same once you create the date object. pastDate = new Date(Date.parse('2006-01-18T12:37:00.000+00:00')); return [ pastDate.getDate(), monthNames[pastDate.getMonth()], pastDate.getFullYear() ].join(' '); This would give you something like this: 19 January 2006 This is just a crude example. You can find a lot more info on formatting a date [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1056728/formatting-a-date-in-javascript).
I hate the same debate with him over e-mail regarding { } for single lines. I even remember the non sequitur "I'm sorry I hurt your feelings" being tossed in there.
TIL that people think you should write 100+ line functions in Javascript. &gt;.&gt;
Just one tough for now: Excelent Idea!!!
It was an example and if you say you haven't seen code like this before then you haven't been doing this for very long.
If you have an example of this in your code, you should fix it before you start worrying about what JSLint has to say. And if you don't, then it's a rather facile example. In the (quite a few years') time I've been doing Javascript, I have indeed seen functions that were more than 100 lines long. What I have never seen are functions that needed to be more than 100 lines long. The only valid reason to write a function that long is if it's a function pretending to be an object, so that you can use local scope to imitate private variables.
Oh wow, nevermind then. There should indeed be a flag for that. [Edit: Here's a report of this behavior.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4646455/)
FWIW I used to work in that team (left several months ago) and wrote up a blog post expending on their announcement - http://nodejs.davidherron.com/2011/11/yahoo-reveals-their-nodejs-mojito.html
I don't agree with your use of `continue` there, but I support your right to use it if you choose, and I agree with your comment about Crockford's hard rules.
God, know-it-all teenagers are insufferable. The whole point of JSLint is conform your code to a particular subset and style. That style is the style of it's author. If you don't agree with the opinions of the author, you are not required to use the tool. 
&gt; That's the paradox here: the philosophy and implementation do not match. imho it does match because right at the top of the intstruction it says: &gt; **Warning!** &gt; &gt; JSLint will hurt your feelings. But Mr. Crockford could explain better why you can't turn that feature off. Just saying "there were good reasons" is so petty, that by itself is no reason, it's on the same level as "because".
&gt; I completely agree that that's the point of JSLint, which is why I think it's misleadingly named, and why I'm surprised it's so widely used. Do you know any other tool which does similar things? I don't. But I'm wondering why the other dev doesn't just branch it and introduce that feature, shouldn't be to difficult.
These are warnings and don't influence the code at all.
Just out of curiosity, what don't you like about continue there? or do you just not like continue in general? I don't typically like to use it, because it's a strange interruption of control flow, but I make an exception for this case because it's always the first line in the loop, and is very straightforward (and because it's a pattern, it shouldn't be confusing, since the reader would see it everywhere in the code).
lol! I didn't even consider it that way, but technically I think you're right! Also, there's very sane reasons to turn it off; for instance, by my own _coding_ standards -- and even the coding standards at my place of employment -- disallow any use of single-character identifiers _unless they're used for a counter in a loop_. Note that I said 'coding', and not 'JavaScript', because this is a basic standard that transcends language. Unless you're the only person that will ever read your code, there's very few, if any, practical uses of single-char vars outside of loops. Anyways, point being that if you only ever use "`i`" with loops, then it's silly to force you to declare the counter var in a totally different location than where it's used, and I'll dare go so far as to say that I believe such a practice would only serve to _introduce_ bugs rather than prevent them because now that little loop you wrote, that should only take up X contiguous lines, is now taking up X+1 non-contiguous lines. Considering that, I believe this coding standard is as much convention as anything; I rarely see single-char vars used at all outside of loops, and I randomly browse code on the net practically every day.
I just like to use `continue` sparingly in general. It makes the control flow less obvious than the indenting and brackets. I do use it sometimes though. I'm interested to see, here, that UglifyJS doesn't optimise the `continue` out like Closure Compiler does. I wonder if they have a good reason.
Haha, despite the name of the link and the github, I was thinking that it was a means to inject named arguments... shows how much I was paying attention!
it's a pretty advanced optimization, I think it's just that closure compiler is a bit more aggressive and robust on the optimization front looks like closure compiler corrected my multi "var"s as well :)
I'm not defending that forced feature. I just don't use jslint that much and then ignore those warnings. But it annoys me a bit too, esp. for those loops. It violates conciseness and locality. `i` is not a variable carrying a big meaning and it's use is very local, it should only be used in the loop. What annoys me too is that when you do use `for (var i;` twice my editor complains that I have declared `i` twice. In closing: JavaScript could do with more scopes.
I setup my code to be run through jslint *and* jshint. No regrets.
Shrug. I'm being honest. The thing is, you have to pick your battles. Yeah, I think Coffeescript looks pretty, but there is a cost to that prettiness -- you have to find time to study and practice it. More time than it takes to post on Reddit. ;-) Also, if you think most comments on reddit are meaningful, well... :)
I'm going to go out on a limb here and posit that the larger your dev team is, the more likely you're going to require curly braces everywhere. It just helps with consistency, and with devs of differing backgrounds and skill levels, they might not always make the correct call that it's merely "an edge case". Pretty soon they're putting non-trivial code lacking curly braces, and then, inevitably, a bug appears. I've seen examples like this (yes, I wish I was kidding): for (var p in obj) { if (!obj.hasOwnProperty(p)) continue; { // do something } } That is a short example, but if you have a compound expression in the `if()` then it can become harder to spot, and due to the nature of JS, the extra braces are purely ignored, and so while the code is functional and will still work as expected, it's written in a very misleading way and you're just setting someone up for failure sooner or later.
Actually, I agree with him. I just thought it was an interesting read.
I just use each(obj, function(item) {}) everywhere instead - performance be damned.
It's impressive that it will still work as intended ;) By some happy accident. Reminds me of Homer Simpson's "eeny meeny miny mo" approach to averting a nuclear meltdown.
That's a jQuery method isn't it?
The jQuery syntax is `$.each(obj, function (idx, item) {})` which is slightly different. (I think most people just use `this` as the iterated value variable, in which case you don't need any arguments to the anonymous function.) When I have it included, I prefer to use underscore.js' [`_.each()`](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/#each), which "delegates to the native forEach function if it exists."
Now you are putting words in my mouth. I never said that functions **needed** to be 100 lines long. I merely stated that 100+ line functions are quite common and having variables at the top makes them even more difficult to read than they already are. Given your "quite a few years" experience I don't think you can debate that.
That is easy for you to say, but consider someone like me; at my job, I inherited a codebase that is 1 million loc, and much of it is JS, and much of it is JS produced via PHP. This code was started by a guy who didn't even know how to program, using Notepad, since early 2000's. You name a coding WTF and I can either rival or beat it. I started working there 3 years ago. I've spent most of my extra efforts in cleaning up the code and getting it organized, and it's still a mess. You see, we're PCI-DSS and HIPAA compliant. I just can't go in and start changing code and check it in; there has to be a very precise and administrated bug ticket created before I can commit _anything_. On top of this, we just so happen to be in a bad economy. I want to try and see you tell the CEO and CTO that you think pruning all functions over 100 lines long to be under 100 lines will have **any** sort of quantifiable and immediate RoI, because I don't believe that case can be made. _Should_ I have small functions? Yes. Is it at the top of my list? Not by a long shot. You see, other things, such as real bugs, take precedence. Those have a very clear and direct relationship to customer satisfaction, and though it's true the messy code lends itself to more bugs, you just can't tell paying clients to suck it up for a year or 2 while you get things in order. Also, things like unit tests aren't going to write themselves, and I happen to think that you should write tests _before_ you refactor, not during or after. But that brings up a larger point -- with so much of the code in such a mess, it's quite obvious that large portions simply need to be completely re-engineered and rewritten. So, in the end, if you have a poor architecture, merely breaking up large functions is going to get you nowhere. You're just going to be dealing with poor architecture spread across even more functions, and for what benefit? That they're short? Congrats, you've just wasted time that you should've spent gathering specs on your current implementation, writing unit tests, and actually moving forward with a workable solution that is not simply pouring more money down the drain painting an old turd. But, according to you, I shouldn't use JSLint, right?
The funny thing is that JSLint contains functions that are 100+ lines. And to be honest, the var thing is confusing as hell when you see `var i, j, p, q, n;` That being said, variable hoisting is an issue. Let can't come soon enough.
I agree and this is how/why Crockford designed jsLint, for large dev teams working on various projects and maintaining code that isn't necessarily theirs. This is why I don't complain much about stuff in jsLint that seem draconian because every once in a while someone will be working on someone else's code that didn't follow the lint and they'll get burned by some syntactical shortcut or "clever" code the first person used. My favourite quote from one of his talks is: &gt;"It rarely happens" means "It happens" It's so true and for the cost of an extra bit of verbosity you can easily avoid the problem in the first place.
You would be impressed by PHP too, then :D Works exactly the same.
Thanks for reminding me I should go outside on my holiday. So long, Internet!
No, it hasn't. EDIT: [Here's a breathless article](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/networking/is-internet-explorer-dying/1595) by the legendarily unbiased Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols, that uses the same data source.
Why the duplication?
You saying it's a happy accident if any PHP code works as intended? ;)
I didn't mean to put words in your mouth or imply that you thought functions needed to be extremely long. I just meant to say that, if you have functions that long, you have more severe problems to deal with than JSLint being picky about where you declare your variables. And that refactoring would not only make the hoisting debate somewhat moot, but also is something you need to have anything like maintainable code.
I shudder to think of an application that dynamically generates Javascript with PHP handling HIPAA data. To be honest, and this isn't really an answer, I wouldn't take that kind of a job, so I admit that I haven't encountered anything that gnarly. I do think that a CTO that can't see the case for refactoring in terms of technical debt shouldn't have that job.
Reasoning behind his decisions aside, he sure comes off as a rude jerk.
&gt; "private" does not add anything new to a property. If you don't want the property to be used outside of the class ... don't use the property outside of the class. Who's "you" in this sentence? The reason private properties exist as a concept is because the programmer consuming the class is not the same person as the programmer writing the class, and the programmer writing the class wants the freedom to change that aspect without worrying about breaking dependencies owned by someone else.
Thanks for weighing in, I'm excited to learn more about it all.
I agree. There is a definite separation between the consumer of the class and the provider. Sometimes "you" just want to use an API and have it give you meaningful error messages based on the semantics of the class.
Here's the source of information for those looking: http://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=1
I don't follow. Is that sarcasm? Is Steven biased? Are you going on the desktop numbers alone [still ~52.635] ?
Why not Zoidbrowser?
I didn't quite follow it either. The very first image caption on his linked page even said, point blank, IE market was share below 50%. &gt;*IE drops below 50% of the Web browser market.*
I found there were a couple things one would catch but not the other. Can't remember what off the top of my head though.
IE dropped below 50% market share in my heart years ago.
&gt;In rails there doesn't seem to be an elgant concept for ajax at least in our perspective. I hear this sometimes about Django as well. What exactly is it that you guys are wanting your server side framework to do for ajax? HTTP is HTTP. Return the data the client requested. Am I missing something?
Luckily for us, IE of any version accounts for only ~6% of traffic here on reddit.com :D
I'm not entirely sure what you're asking, but a couple pointers: - Don't use the Array constructor (i.e. new Array), just use **array literals**. When you want an array, just write it out like so: var courses = []; // create array // populate array courses[0] = [ "ACC 202", "Financial Accounting", "B", 0 ]; You can even create multidimensional arrays with literals: // create and populate array var courses = [ ["ACC 202", "Financial Accounting", "B", 0], ["EDU 201", "Learning Theories","AB", 0], ["ENG 201", "Composition and Rhetoric", "B", 0] ] You would access info like so: console.log( courses[0][0] ); // prints "ACC 202" to the console - For storing information on individual courses, an array is not really a good choice. An array is for a *list* of things...that's not really what a course is. A course is a thing that has some various properties, like "grade". An object would be a better fit. You can create object literals just like arrays: var courses = []; // create array // populate array courses[0] = { class : "ACC 202", description : "Financial Accounting", grade : "B", semester: 0 }; You could then access the various properties like so: console.log( course[0].grade ) // prints "B" to the console You can create an array of objects like so: var courses = [ { class : "ACC 202", description : "Financial Accounting", grade : "B", semester : 0 }, { class : "EDU 201", description : "Learning Theories", grade : "AB", semester : 0 }, { class : "ENG 201", description : "Composition and Rhetoric", grade : "B", semester : 0 } ] Of course, all these object literals can get tiresome...so you might want to create a helper function: function class( class, desc, grade, semester ) { return { class : class, description : desc, grade : grade, semester : semester } } This function takes some properties and returns an object populated with them. You'd use it like so: var courses = [ class("ACC 202", "Financial Accounting", "B", 0), class("EDU 201", "Learning Theories","AB", 0), class("ENG 201", "Composition and Rhetoric", "B", 0) ] You could also use a constructor: function Class( class, desc, grade, semester ) { this.class = class; this.description = desc; this.grade = grade; this.semester = semester; } Which would be used the same way, but with the addition of "new": var courses = [ new Class("ACC 202", "Financial Accounting", "B", 0), new Class("EDU 201", "Learning Theories","AB", 0), new Class("ENG 201", "Composition and Rhetoric", "B", 0) ] - Check out [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/), it's a great way to play around easily with JavaScript. When you have a problem or get stuck on something, create an example JSFiddle that demonstrates it and send the link to people. They will then have a much easier time helping you. - You mention W3Schools...[stay away from that site](http://w3fools.com/). The site I just linked to provides alternate sources to use instead. - Check out [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) a **free** book for beginning (JavaScript) programmers. - In terms of a real-world application, your list of classes would probably be stored as [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)... Your JavaScript would then load the JSON, perhaps via AJAX, and then loop through the list of courses and build up a menu/whatever. For a simple demo/example like this, you can skip the JSON/loading step and just have an object/array.
If it is known that a class cannot span multiple semesters and course IDs are unique, then you want something like this: var courses = { 'Fall 2008': { 'ACC 202': 'Financial Accounting', 'EDU 201': 'Learning Theories', 'ENG 201': 'Composition and Rhetoric', 'GTW 100': 'Gateways I', 'HIS 293': 'Traditional China', 'ITM 200': 'Intro to Computers' }, 'Spring 2009': { 'ECO 205': 'Principles of Macroeconomics', 'ENG 102': 'Composition and Rhetoric II', 'GIS 101': 'Global Lifestyles &amp; Resource Use', 'GTW 102': 'Gateways 2' }, 'Summer 2009': { 'MAT 109': 'ALGEBRA &amp; TRIGNOMETRY', 'BIO 112': 'Enviromental Science' } }; You may access arrays like: console.log(courses['Spring 2009']['ACC 202']); // outputs "Financial Accounting" To loop through the semester names: for ( semester in courses ) { console.log(semester); // Outputs "Fall 2008", etc } To loop through course names for a given semester: for ( course_id in courses['Fall 2008']) { console.log(course_id); // Outputs "ACC 202", etc } But I highly recommend you build this out more. This is only a starting block. YmMotHimself gave some excellent advice.
More fun to troll trolls.
wow... That was extremely helpful! Thank you! I'm going to work on it a bit more and play with JSFiddle. If I have any questions is it okay if I reply to this message again in the future?
Unfurtunately, the percentage of customers still using IE is the one that matters the most, (big companies and such).
Great! That helped! Thank you.
Sure, feel free to pm or reply to me any time for help with anything, and I'll see what I can do.
The problem isn't that IE still has 50% of the market share, but that IE 8, 7, and by some metrics even IE 6, are more popular then IE 9. 
I just wanted to add one more thing: Another way you could structure things is to make courses an object as well, instead of an array. You would pick a course property to use to index them, like say the course name. So: var courses = { "ACC 202" : { description : "Financial Accounting", grade : "B", semester : 0 }, "EDU 201" : { description : "Learning Theories", grade : "AB", semester : 0 } } Now you can use the course title to look up it's properties: var class = "EDU 201"; console.log( courses[ class ].description ) // prints "Learning Theories" to the console
&gt; God, know-it-all teenagers are insufferable. I don't understand this. _Everyone_ in that thread is polite, except for Doug. They're just asking for one more configurable option in a tool where there are already _more than thirty_ such configurable options. If the point is to make sure that everyone codes _exactly_ like Doug Crockford, then why have the options at all?
[Relevant!](http://www.benhuh.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Professor-Farnsworth-futurama-3295264-800-600-430x322.jpg)
Playing devils advocate, I would say that there is a spectrum of no-nos and playing fast and loose with scope confusion would land squarely in the black (at least in javascript) And that's why it's not configurable in the first place. The point of the tool is to write resilient multi-developer code. Not "ninja" code. But, I don't actually think Crockford is actually being rude simply cause he says that line all the time: &gt; "You can write all the crappy code you want. I don't care, because you don't work for me." If he had read javascript the good parts or heard [his lectures](http://yuiblog.com/crockford/), he would have recognized that line and probably wouldn't have taken offense. Crockford's just saying that it's a book / lecture / tool on Javascript his way, and it's about his opinions and you can take it or leave it. 
Am I the only one who read that in Professor Farnsworth's voice? As for the article, cool! (If it's true)
Apparently Douglas Crockford doesn't think it's out of the question. There are numerous 100+ line functions in the [LSLint source](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSLint/blob/master/jslint.js).
Regarding the numbers, posts with titles similar to this one are submitted every month. The headline is catchy, but it would be more accurate to say, "According to a single data source, Internet Explorer has possibly - 'possibly' due to the margin of error - dropped below 50% browser market share." (Based on Steven's past statements about Microsoft and its software, I think it's safe to say that he doesn't like Microsoft. When he rings a death knell, I think it should be taken with a grain of salt - and he's chosen this single data source to ring said death knell. That doesn't imply that this source has incorrectly measured usage according to their methodology - but again, the salt grain.) EDIT: Wording.
The use of continue in this case reduce the cyclomatic complexity of the code. And that is good, anytime, anywhere, any language.
I've been working with php for 7 years, and I could say exactly that :)
2011, the year of the linux desktop.

Wait, did I get that right, that Mojito can run on a device without any backend if needed, so with a Node.JS server on for example the iPad? Or is it just YUI available if offline?
Desktops are so 2010.
50% is still too much to be ignored, thus i'm not opening any bottles yet.. what we need is tools that make it easier to work around the problems (better developer tools, normalized css, modernizer, etc), so we can create something without spending 90% of the time debugging it.

MOAAAR COWBELL!!!!! lol I love it Raynos.
The trollathlon started.
Lots of rage. jQuery is good for lots of stuff. Some times you shouldn't (or don't need to) use it so... don't. End of story.
Out of curiosity when would you say you *needed* to use it?
I couldn't agree more, it's like jQuery is "load more; know less".
@raynos I agree completely. Would love to know your thoughts on MooTools though. I use it in pretty much every project but only when required. If some site only has one event to show an element I will polyfill the events myself (attatchEvent -&gt; addEventListener, I hate you Microsoft) and save the page weight 20kb or so. I havent moved into using micro libraries yet. Although I have loved coding my EventEmitter. I can see the benefits of using these small specific libraries over huge all purpose ones. It's quite nice to add your own $ shortcut too. (function($) { var myElement = $('myElement'); }(document.getElementById));
Ahem... http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/lytam/c_is_a_horrible_language_linus_torvalds/
We know where it came from :P thats why its funny!!
Thank you. That page and those videos explained nothing.
Fair enough :) but it sounds like some people are taking it seriously... ;)
*(Not sure if serious or....but I'll bite.*) It seems the crux of your argument is because jQuery lets you do 'horrible' things, it must be 'horrible', which is *horribly* faulty logic. I can use a car to murder someone, but that doesn't make the car bad. With great power comes great responsibility and all that... I'd like to see your cross browser implementations of fadeIn/Out, animate, ajax, etc... or do you prefer a different library? Or do you just not do anything like that? One of the nice things about jQuery or moo tools, or whatever, is not having to reinvent the wheel. Sure I *could* write some POJS to do anything jQuery does...but why? My clients and I have much better things to do with our time. 
I heard you like promoting broken code. `var $ = document.getElementById` `$("foo"); // throws error` MooTools is a better library then jQuery, although personally I just use the DOM-shim.
I have a cross browser implementation of DOM4 (ish) called the [DOM-shim](https://github.com/Raynos/DOM-shim). I'm working on a cross browser implementation of XHR2. Seriously though, [my article on DOM libraries](http://raynos.org/blog/10/DOM-Libraries) states why, we use libraries for normalization and abstraction. I don't want abstraction, I only want normalization. And existing libraries don't do normalization.
Yeah, I don't really get the "Good news, everyone!" part. The world of web browsers is still fragmented, and will be for the foreseeable future. The problems you describe will all continue, and possibly worsen now that we have HTML5*. This news item doesn't change anything. 
maybe. For example, it'd be nice to be able to use the domain model as a source for AJAX responses. In the same way you use MVC on the client side, it may be beneficial to consider the AJAX response as a "View", and the controller would shape the AJAX response according to the request. This might include content-type negotiation, parameterization, bi-directional serialization from the in-memory domain objects to JSON or XML, and so on. ASPNET MVC does some of this in the .NET world. I don't know what's available in RoR, so it could be that some or all of this is already available. 
Derp. Sorry about that. You actually have to make the $ shortcut run `document.getElementById`. Like this. function $(id) { return document.getElementById(id); } The DOM shim looks great. Well done! It's nice to have the classes that MooTools provides. Although native ones will be a lot better they do the job. I am sure there is a micro framework for classes anyway.
good point.
Well there's [pd](https://github.com/Raynos/pd). All the sugar you need to make ES5 OO easy.
+1 for Mootools. I realize the OP is tongue and cheek, but I still don't like jQuery. I find it's messy, the effects libraries are weak, and relies too heavily on 3rd party plug-ins with their own version and 3rd party plug-in dependencies. I also like how you can take as much or as little of the library as you need per project.
An employer is rarely going to tell prospective employees that the code is essentially a gigantic pile of shit. And it's not that the CTO doesn't see the value in it, but do the costs justify it? If you're just applying a band-aid -- or something even more trivial, like refactoring functions to have line counts &lt;100 -- to what is basically a [big ball of mud](http://www.laputan.org/mud/); then no, the costs will not justify the work. And therein lies the problems with these monolithic, archaic codebases: the coupling is so high, the architecture so poor, and the risk of introducing new defects is so high....where does one start? And is it even possible to make satisfactory gains without rewriting from scratch? Sometimes yes, sometimes no, sometimes maybe. It sure would be nice to be like you, though, with the ability to cherry-pick jobs (especially in this economy) that only have pristine codebases, though.
anyone else click on "delete post" button? Just to see what would happen?
Oh I'm not at the Guardian myself, just thought it was of interest. Good to see the paper be transparent about tech stuff like this.
Is there a way to see which part of the world map is actually used? I dont know the google maps link syntax, but maybe you can generate a link out of that option panel
Oh wow. This is smooth as hell.
Seems like an unnecessary rewrite to me, especially if there was a lot of code already.
I'm one of the few who still has to develop (occasionally) with IE6 in mind. A giant corporation who shall not be named but who is amazingly (given their lack of browser savvy) based in San Francisco requires their javascript heavy internal sites to work in IE6. The work... it's... haunting.
When you have tight deadlines and don't have the time to build requirements/spec out a full DOM cross-browser compatibility library that encompasses browsers _that you can't even reliably test on your hardware_. So, instead of taking blind stabs in the dark and copy/pasting code from some geocities-like website, and dealing with the hundreds of hours of testing and refactoring required to support IE6 or IE on Mac or whatever, you go to jQuery.com, download, and get to working on the actual project within 30 seconds. Or, you could waste 100's of hours writing your own library due to your NIH-xenophobia and not even have your lib finished by the time the due date hits.
Too late, all the cool kids are using "promises" in their "microframeworks" now days.
We are not objecting to you using a tool for cross browser compliance. Writing your own is time consuming. We are objecting to you using jQuery as your cross browser compliance tool when better options exist.

Hi, I'm pretty new to JavaScript, and I'm trying to understand this syntax. I've seen it multiple times, but I don't quite understand why it's written this way. (function(xyz) { // do something here }(abc)) Could someone help me understand the purpose of this structure, and what it's doing? I'd appreciate it.
FFS can we stop introducing idiotic jargon? "Cocktails"....really? Once again, Yahoo assumes the role of the nerdy nerdy kid that showed up for class with a box of 32 million crayolas, when all that was required was the basic 8-pack.
It really is, especially because these are the real problems that people have faced (as opposed to all of the hypotheticals that arm-chair programmers like to rant about on their crappy blogs all day).
"We"? You and what army?
I've added a [ Show map ] link next to the search box. It opens a new tab with google maps centered on the location, at the same zoom the blocks are sampled. The extent is not right, though, because it depends on the browser window dimensions. I was thinking of adding a google maps control in the page to show the rendered region and select new positions, but [this bug](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=95955) is still not fixed on Chrome stable.
It says the server side JS is only used if the browser does not support javascript. So your iPad would basically be running local JS, but a non-smartphone browser (their example) gets the interactivity from the server.
It's WebGL, and there isn't a lot of geometry or complex shaders. But yes: the future is looking amazing :)
This can only end badly.
Sure. This method of encapsulating your script essentially sandboxes your code. All code within the wrapper will be run but any variables / functions will not leak out into the global variable namespace unless you specifically tell them to. Heres a little example. (function(globalObject) { function foo() { // This function is private to this wrapper // It can only be called from inside this wrapper } // This line will drop our foo function into the global object // This works because we are passing `this` to our anonymous function // As long as it is not nested then `this` will equal `window` or `exports` depending on your JavaScript environment globalObject.foo = foo; }(this)); It can be a little confusing. But this helps you to create more modular code that will not pollute the browser with random variables and functions. Just ask if you still don't get something :)
Yes, and admin:admin didn't work.
touche raynos, touche.
I *want* a toolkit that contains everything I regularly use, tested in all browsers, by thousands of people, and optimized wherever speed is an issue. jQuery saves me a lot of time and effort. I don't want to write my own implementations of $(':input'), $.animate(), $.ajax() and many other features. And jQuery's overhead is worth it, considering all the optimizations it contains. Sure, I could grab multiple open-source single-purpose libraries and put them together, but I would get an inconsistent mess, often no community support and bad documentation.
&gt; Playing devils advocate, I would say that there is a spectrum of no-nos and playing fast and loose with scope confusion would land squarely in the black (at least in javascript) And that's why it's not configurable in the first place. The point of the tool is to write resilient multi-developer code. Not "ninja" code. So coding weaknesses exist on a gradient, then, and Crockford is saying that scope confusion is too great a weakness to abide a switch. That's perfectly reasonable to argue, and _of course_ it's his tool, and nobody is saying otherwise. I replied to your original comment because it implied that (a) people were insufferable to ask for it as if they knew better; (b) it's a cut-and-dry issue and therefore not worth arguing. Also, you imply that the person who opened the issue hasn't read or seen any of Crockford's work, but why? He might have recognized the line, but felt it irrelevant to the discussion at hand. Doug isn't being rude, but neither is he being polite; he's simply being Doug. I think it's worth it to be diplomatic to anyone who's arguing in good faith, and not to respond to someone who is asking legitimate questions with a trite "I am sorry I hurt your feelings" — even if it's just to point them to a FAQ somewhere. But that's a meta-discussion.
No community support and bad documentation just means you picked bad libraries. Use a tool like ender and a collection of good hand picked libraries.
IE market share isn't the problem, the plurality of IE is.
Thanks for the assistance! Okay, I think I understand, let's see if I have this right. The (function(globalObject)...) syntax is an anonymous function which is being called (in this example) with "this" passed as an argument, and assuming a typical browser context, would be the window object. In a node.js environment it would be the 'exports' global object. Then, the global object is being extended with the up-until-now- private function "foo", so that we can call foo() outside of the wrapper. This looks to me like a closure, but I'm not sure that it's entirely accurate to call it that. I do, however, understand this syntax much better, thank you! I'm saving this comment away to review again a few times to make sure I've really got it. I'd like to ask, I've seen "namespacing" done by assigning an object to a variable like so: var myThing = { foo: function () { // Do things here }, bar: new Array; }; Is there a reason to use the former over the latter, or is it more a matter of preference? Thanks so much, I feel like I'm overcoming a big knowledge hurdle here. I really should find a good reference for learning to code in this style, because it feels much more modern to me than what I've been learning.
Centered text? Fuck you, too.
You hit the nail on the head! Thats exactly how it works. I have never used name spacing myself in my JavaScript but I suppose the major libraries are prime examples. jQuery sticks everything in the `jQuery` global and creates an alias of `$`. MooTools splits the whole library up into multiple global objects such as `Fx` and `Request` and performs a lot of extension of existing globals. `Element` for example. I think if you are trying to write modular code that can just be bolted together then name spacing is a great idea, it just helps to stop a conflict. I think it also helps as a kind of source code annotation. You can see that `ui.buttons.Submit` will be a button that will submit something and is part of the user interface. I have experimented with name spacing in a script I wrote called [Package.js](https://github.com/Wolfy87/Package.js). But that is all about checking if a script has been loaded via a namespace and loading it if not. Like Java's import. Well, I say like it, it is no where near as good. So they are both good, they both keep code separate and clean. I would suggest using name spacing for larger projects and more reusable code. But I would use name spacing in conjunction with the sandboxing wrapper, just so you can define private functions etc. It also allows things like [Google Closure Compiler](http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/) to minify your code better.
Global variables "don't influence the code at all"? Really?
I don't mean to argue. I want to understand why people want features like this. Serious questions: Your class **foo** has a private property **bar** and I do this: var o = new foo(); o.bar = "some value"; What happens? If it throws an error, then I have to know about all your private properties anyway. If I'm expected not to arbitrarily add properties to objects then I'm not using Javascript anymore. Having typed out that question it occurs to me that having to check for private properties isn't substantially different from having to check that I'm not overwriting an existing property anyway. If overwriting a private property threw an error it would not be significantly limiting for that reason at least. What if the class **foo** with a private property **bar** had a prototype object in which **bar** was public? Would getting **bar** from objects of the **foo** class through an error or return the prototype's property or undefined or what? Can I make a temporary variable inside a function private and prevent it from being captured by nested functions? Right now the rules for scope are substantially similar to the rules for object-prototype chains. Does that change? There's probably a bunch of mailing lists that have argued all these questions already, but I needed to type them my self to think more deeply about them. If you don't think these questions are important, I don't mind. 
To be honest its really only blind stabs in the dark if you don't take the time to learn your trade. By your logic we should all be using GUI site builders then to really get stuff done. The other mistake you make is assuming you need a full fledged library to get things done.
I am a javascript developer not worth my salt. Where may I read about hoisting? :)
Props to them for posting about this, but shouldn't they be using [.prop()](http://api.jquery.com/prop/) for changing the disabled property?
I don't know why but this one seems a lot stronger than all the other ones out there. Good work.
Freaky, but is it supposed to jump, or be smooth?
No. disabled= is an attribute that physically exists as a node in the DOM, and therefore should be accessed using attr(). prop() is for properties which are accessible by JavaScript, but have no representation in the DOM (like, for example, node.ownerDocument).
Here is a decent write up on scoping and hoisting. http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/2/JavaScript-Scoping-and-Hoisting But just google around it is pretty well documented.
According to the jQuery api, .prop() should be used as a setter for boolean attributes like disabled and checked: "The .prop() method should be used to set disabled and checked instead of the .attr() method. The .val() method should be used for getting and setting value." The Guardian post shows that they are indeed setting the disabled attribute.
Please use this link instead. It appears to be a slightly more valid test. http://jsperf.com/indexof-vs-regextest/2
The difference between Opera and others on this test are astounding. They must have some secret to regex in js.
The browser list seems to be changing for me, IE9 list keeps growing and shrinking. It'd be nice to see a complete list of all the browsers, thanks!
&gt; To be honest its really only blind stabs in the dark if you don't take the time to learn your trade. So, according to you, I should have memorized every single nuance and bug for every browser that is available on every platform? Or are you expecting me to procure every platform and browser combination? Either way, that's impractical, and you know it. &gt; By your logic we should all be using GUI site builders then to really get stuff done. What kind of strawman argument is that? Care to actually offer a point of contention, or will you be content with your sweeping generalizations? And besides, GUI page builders work great for some people. My cousin needed a website for a garage sale, and she whipped one up in a GUI in under 15 minutes. Does it look "web 2.0"? Not really. Is it a shining example of best practices and UX mastery? Not at all. Did it fulfill her needs perfectly? Yup. They're also used all the time for silly eBay storefronts and whatnot, but does it matter? It's solving their problem, so wtf do you care how it was solved? &gt; The other mistake you make is assuming you need a full fledged library to get things done. Congrats on hopping on the microframework bandwagon. I'll see you in a year when you realize that loading up 19 different "micros" with incompatible API's, differing support points, overlapping features, and varying quality just isn't as good in practice as it is in your brain.
lol, the great prop() fiasco. Possibly one of the worst things every to happen to jQuery. &gt; Hey, although we advertise no BC-breaks, we're breaking the BC for a pedantic reason! _later that year_ &gt; Hey, we came to the brilliant conclusion that BC breaks are bad, so we reverted our previous BC break! But, you should use the new way, even though we promise the old way doesn't break BC, just because we like to be pedantic about it. Nevermind that this will cause untold amounts of confusion and bugs to the users. Hope you guys enjoyed all that refactoring that was required to support the BC-breaking changes, that is now moot! Or if you put off upgrading due to the BC-breaking changes, now you can upgrade! _some time later_ &gt; Oh yeah, that revert we did to remove the BC-break, actually contains BC-breaks after all. However, we added this crap called deferreds and promises and callbacks that 1% of you cried for! Enjoy!
lol, a Node.js suggestion. Color me surprised.
The term "microframework" is poorly coined. All it means is unix philosophy. Use a tool to do one thing and one thing well. Use many of them. And yes they do work, if you pick the right ones. If you want to you can go back to your monolothic frameworks to do everything for you, including holding your hand.
What? What's wrong with "promises". It's simply a mechanism for flow control. And what's wrong with "microframeworks", it's simply a bad name for the unix philosophy
Go back? That'd require me to first leave, which I have not done. And don't get me wrong, I'm [far from a JQ fanboy](http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/lz15c/how_a_javascript_upgrade_brought_down_our_the/c2wtayp), but at the same time, it has a much better (proven) track record than `MomAndPop.js`, and if that means that I don't have to reinvent the wheel and/or spend untold amounts of time researching and testing micros, then that means more time for me to [work on my core business functions instead of wasting time on problems that other people have already solved](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000007.html), likely better than I would be able to solve them in the first place. Are you sure that you're not David Mark? If not, you share the same penchant for dissing jQuery while at the same time pushing your own library, which does give the impression that you're motivated by reasons other than the relative quality of code between the 2 libraries.
GAAH you said Web 2.0... oh my lord... Your arguments honestly just scream "I dont feel like learning I just want to follow what this framework does blindly!" And yeah that works for some people, but those are the people we are complaining about. As for the micro framework argument.. they are micro.. so small in fact you can actually read and understand everything going on (again goes back to learning your trade). In reality its much easier to find an incompatibility or an issue if one exists. MS Word solved peoples problems for web development, and just caused problems for the people who actually had to come in fix and maintain the mess.... The whole point of the argument is this, tools that make it easy for the lamon, or people who don't care also makes it easy to make absolute garbage and cause a lot of headaches. If used properly I don't have an issue with jQuery I've written a couple of plugins myself, and have the jQuery bronze badge on SO. However I don't think theres ever an argument where you *HAVE* to use jQuery over JavaScript, other than for convenience to the developer. 
As of this posting, Google's CDN doesn't seem to be available yet. [Google CDN](https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7/jquery.min.js)
Not a Javascript upgrade that caused the problem. They didn't update Javascript. The thing that caused the problem was a poor testing process. They were testing something that weren't running, and running something they weren't testing. 
&gt; What? What's wrong with "promises". It's simply a mechanism for flow control. Just pointing out that devs have been asking for enterprise-level help with jQuery (such as OO and/or MVC structure and functionality) practically since jQuery came to be, and yet promises were a concept that sprung up relatively recently and TBH I had never heard of them before they landed in jQuery proper. &gt; And what's wrong with "microframeworks", it's simply a bad name for the unix philosophy While useful by themselves, it's hardly practical to spend your entire session at the command line scripting and piping all day. The unix philosophy allows devs to easily create complex applications by simply piecing the smaller components together, and without these more complex applications, unix wouldn't be anywhere close to where it is today. I'm not against micros so much as all of the fanboys trumpeting them like they're the cure for cancer. I somewhat agree with the application of the unix philosophy here, but at the same, I don't want a separate micro for every single little feature that I want to implement. I just see jQuery as a Swiss-army knife: it handles 99% of the common tasks that I need to handle, and it handles them pretty damn good, even if I wanted a fork and a spoon but all I can use is a spork -- I can still solve my problems, and solve them fast.
Yeah, unfortunately Crockford is a bit of a dick
If you want to wank off to design patterns then use Coffeescript. That's the beauty of Javascript: you can throw a meta framework over it if its not cool enough for you as is.
Hey, promises are amazing. 
Well considering I just sent them the file 15 minutes ago, that is not surprising. :) It usually takes a day for the Google and Microsoft CDNs to get the file up, as the blog mentions.
Interesting. My tests show them about the same, except Firefox 7 where indexOf is much faster, and Opera 11 where the regexp is **much much** faster. FYI, I had to modify you test to get it to run on FireFox 3.6 (it apparently doesn't like the test harness) and the results were about the same as FF7: indexOf was somewhat faster. However there's a couple things that make me dubious about this test: - It's just testing the same strings over and over. - It only tests successful matches. - It only tests one length, section of string, etc etc... So I quickly threw together a test which will pit the methods against each other in a variety of circumstance, this will in theory better determine how they behave on average. Each is tested on both successful matches and on failures. I also tested global regexp's vs non-global ones. On the successful ones, the length and location of the match varies. I threw this test together pretty quickly, so it's definitely not perfect...but I was curious how a little variety would affect the results. I think this is closer to testing real-world circumstances. In this new test, Opera behaves more like FireFox...with indexOf being a bit faster than the regexp. I suspect Opera was doing some kind of optimization behind the scenes on the other test, when it saw you were matching the same regexp against the same string over and over. It could be my test is flawed; In my tests each iteration does extra work, so it could just be that is so noisy it drowns out the signal...but I'm still seeing trends for indexOf vs Regexp so it can't be complete noise if that is indeed the case. Perhaps unsurprisingly successful matches are quicker than failed ones...except in FireFox 3.6 where the failed matches are quicker. [Here's the randomized test](http://jsperf.com/indexof-vs-regexp-test-randomized) I hope others will check it out so we can get a good data for various browsers.
I've never been very keen on jQuery, but I do use Dojo quite a lot. I prefer to use POJS when convenient, but for things like drag-and-drop functionality and templates, I find that Dojo is really useful. I guess I would like to get your input on Dojo. I rarely see anyone post anything about it.
&gt; GAAH you said Web 2.0... oh my lord... Yes, because I lived and coded through that time, and I'm seeing many similarities with the current microframeworks and NodeJS **trends**. &gt; As for the micro framework argument.. they are micro.. so small in fact you can actually read and understand everything going on (again goes back to learning your trade). In reality its much easier to find an incompatibility or an issue if one exists. The whole point of using someone else's code is that \*I\* don't HAVE to read or understand it; as long as it works (and doesn't have severe issues with performance, stability, etc.), then that's all that I really care about! It has nothing to do with "learning your trade", it has to do with not wasting time on things that you don't have to. And NOBODY used the phrase "have to", that's all you. The OP used the word "need".
once again, here we see that people confuse jQuery for Javascript. *sigh*
I don't have time for HTML5 *tricks*.
There are a couple of other tools mentioned in this thread. One is [jsHint](http://www.jshint.com/), which was a fork of jsLint, originally intended to simply add configuration options, although their goals have now expanded, apparently.
The fact that there is STILL confusion on this -- in a place where supposedly JS and jQuery knowledge is high -- just highlights what a blunderfuck it was (and still is).
Huh? Just as the guy you replied to points out, it was a testing &amp; validation error more than it was a jQuery error. While jQuery contributed, it was The Guardian's process that led to the problem, and so to imply that jQuery alone caused their problem would be outright misleading.
I just tested this on my work computer (quad i7 w/12GB of ram) set to zoom really far and crazy large size. It took about a minute to load, but after that it was really smooth. It would be cool to show the whole Earth at once. And maybe a toggle button for the auto rotation.
How a **Javascript** upgrade brought down our [The Guardian] commenting platform *-Should read-* How a **jQuery** upgrade brought down our [The Guardian] commenting platform thanks for the downvote, asshat
&gt; thanks for the downvote, asshole BECAUSE KARMA IS SO IMPORTANT!!!! Oh, and, have another!
Looking through the issues, I found [this](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSLint/issues/84) one amusing. Someone points out that JSLint is warning about errors *inside comments*. Crockfords response? "Fix your code." &lt;closes issue&gt;.
It's slow because the Elevation API has a really low query limit (with testing serveral combinations I got to 200 coordinates per second, packed in two requests). After that, generating the geometry and uploading it to the GPU takes a while, too. It would be cool to have the whole Earth at once could be done with a lot of offline work, and the upload the compiled info. I have an idea to get height info more quickly. Toggle button for auto rotation added to options (and greetings!)
You don't have time for his *illusions* niiko
While my phone does support multitouch in the browser, it appears only moving images around works on my device (XPERIA X10). Looking at the code, I'd like to see the images rotate (for example) under my fingers. Cool though.
It seems most Android phones disable multitouch in the stock browser. If you try it with Opera Mobile or on an iPhone/iPad, it will rotate/scale.
I just tested it from my home computer and I saw this: [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/UzYn1.png) This was in FF Nightly (currently version 10.0a1) on Ubuntu. 
AMD support. Nice! Now if only I could wrap my head around requirejs Anyone feel like helping me out?
Require.js works like a charm for me.
Dude, this is were you live?! Wicked! Seriously, though. I've tested it with Windows 7 Nightly and it works, and Chromium 14 in Ubuntu and works, too. The linux machine is an eeepc with an Nvidia Ion. It could be an issue with WebGL in Nightly for Linux, or an issue with the video driver. I don't usually obsess if things don't work as expected on pre-release versions of major browsers :) Thanks for testing and the feedback, of course!
&gt; Seriously though, trolls aside, jQuery is a horrible library. I agree, to an extent. The API is ridiculous. Today I ran into $(selector).before() expecting the $(selector) to be placed before whatever was in the before function. Wrong. There are tons of little things like this that make me question a person's choice in jQuery and no other lib. 
Firefox 9? what the fuck...
You're right. I read the corresponding documentation again, and found the notes that explain what you mean [here](http://api.jquery.com/prop/). Sorry about that. But I agree with the comment by k3n that this is fucked up. * Because: * Consumers of the jQuery API must have knowledge of the HTML standard. You're manipulating the DOM through jQuery, and you can not reasonably do that without having knowledge of the semantics of elements and attributes and their values. It is jQuery's task to provide convient access free of browser differences to the DOM, which the caller of the API assumes to be based on said semantics known to him. But here, jQuery is changing the meaning of some values only in some special case. This must always be remembered by the caller. And as humans can forget or, like me, just don't know things, this is a guaranteed source of errors. They should have just stick with the expected behaviour that I described (assumed) above, without having any special cases. Then they would have had a clean interface at the cost of the caller having to know the HTML standard ( and therefore the difference between .attr("checked") === null and .attr("checked") === "" ), which is like no additional cost, because as I stated earlier you need this knowledge anyways to use jQuery.
I'm not quite groking the optimizer though. Nodejs is totally foreign to me. Is there any way to implement the optimizer without a node server? If I can't install node on the server that we serve javascript from (via apache, on debian 5 / lenny) , do I spin up another instance just to run node an requirejs? Does node then become the fileserver too? It seems like requirejs is the way to go, and I'm trying an implementation of yepnope now (moving away from a non standard loader / dependency handler), but it seems that the benefits are lost without the optimizer.
Yes. It needs Cross Origin Resource Sharing support for Canvas textures.
A trick is something a whore does for money...
&gt; if ( $(element).attr("disabled") ) { // do stuff } In jQuery 1.6, this method now returns "undefined", which Javascript gurus will know is not the same as false (unless you use === comparison). Actually, as JavaScript gurus know... for the purposes of an if-statement *undefined* (as well as *null*, *0*, and other "false-ish" values) is the same as *false*: if ( undefined ) { console.log("Truthy") } else { console.log("False-ish") } Will print "False-ish" to the console. This is because for: if ( expression ) { // blah blah blah } JS takes the result of the expression and does Boolean(result)... and Boolean(undefined) is *false*. (well really it uses GetValue and ToBoolean, but you get the idea). Note however, that *undefined* is not considered equal to *false* for == and **especially not for the stricter** ===. I think what they meant to say was that since it's now evaluating *undefined* the if will **never** trigger, as opposed to sometimes triggering sometimes not like it's supposed to. 
I like Coda by Panic Software.
Actually, I was more shocked that it even exists, I'm on 7...
Nightly is 10, right now. You get Firefox, Beta, Aurora and Nightly. They wanted to stick to a rapid release cycle of six weeks.
I think you only need the node server to run the optimization once locally and it will generate an optimized file. You can [install nodejs easily](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation) locally if you're using a mac, ubuntu, solaris or windows. then just run the optimizer and use the file. :) btw, node is awesome. :D
Ran smooth for me. FF6 on Windows 7.
awesome! the file is already up when i checked, got it running, works fine replacing 1.7-rc2! 
I just don't see why they suddenly went haywire with the major version numbers... guess we'll see Firefox 80 in 5 years time...
Yes, or Windows 87, or Adobe Photoshop CS417. The idea is that there'll only be Firefox, Chrome, Opera, etc. as they update automatically and transparently. You'll be always running your browser and it will be updated. It makes life easier to users and to developers (except, of course Internet Explorer, here's [an interesting article by Paul Irish on the subject](http://paulirish.com/2011/browser-market-pollution-iex-is-the-new-ie6/))
Its interesting that you automatically assumed that I was using closed sourced things like Windows 87 or PS etc... The question was, why bother having major version numbers if they turn over so quickly - your answer is that they don't matter. If I was a browser plugin developer, I would be very wary to touch a platform that *looks* like it is going through a major overhaul over and over...
Right, but running it by hand is not much different from maintaining the set of JS by hand. Wouldn't the deployment / dependancy management gains be mitigated by having to maintain it "out of production"? Or is that not the point? What do you recommend for learning node. I'm trying to learn javascript instead of only use it.
so if you think the title that states "a javascript upgrade" is anywhere near more accurate than "a jQuery upgrade", you are seriously delusional, and probably don't know the difference between javascript and jquery. or, you're just another rabid jquery fanboy who must uphold jquery's name even if it makes you look foolish. IT WAS a jquery upgrade and not a "javascript upgrade" that caused the problem. why is this so difficult for you to understand/admit?
They are exactly equal on Chrome 15.
That was the Wrong Way to remove the attribute anyway; jQuery has the .removeAttr function for just such a scenario.
I automatically assumed nothing. You said "we'll see Firefox 80", the subject of my reply is also "we". The main point, I think, is that the "major" number is the name of browser itself, and the release numbers represent "minor" numbers. You wouldn't be developing for Chrome 17 or Firefox 12, but for Chrome or Firefox. In this case, the code works with stable Chrome. A few weeks ago, it didn't. It doesn't work with stable Firefox right now, but it will in a few weeks. I as a developer can take advantage of future technology and the code will be ready when the update for each browser rolls out. Unless the spec changes, in which case it would break anyway and the code would have to be adapted. I don't see that as a major overhaul over and over.
Alright, well you clearly haven't read the article, or don't understand software. Where there is code, there WILL be bugs, and they WILL make it to production. This incident was a jQuery bug, yes, but if you test and/or deploy the wrong versions of code -- which is precisely what happened here -- then these problems are much more likely to happen. I'm not a fanboy by any means, but please, put your pitchfork down and try to think with a little bit of objectivity here; if the only thing that you took from the article was that there was a jQuery bug, then you really do need to read it again.
no, its very VERY simple you retard. Explain how exactly you "upgrade Javascript". You can't. end of story. You're a fool. I've been coding for 30 years, what part of software do you think I don't understand? They fucking upograde JQUERY. FUCKING JQUERY, not JAVASCRIPT. You're an idiot. The title is wrong, it has nothing to do with Javascript. You are the type of person who says javsacript sucks because you don't know how to work with the DOM. Same thing here. Jquery is not Javascript. Get it through your thick skull. 
OO &amp; MVC in jQuery? That's madness. jQuery is a DOM/Ajax/animation library. You don't need an OO construct, you just need to learn javascript. You also don't need an MVC construct, you just need to learn architecture. I havn't met any of these "x is silver bullet" fanboys. Feel free to shoot them down. Yes microframeworks don't solve all your problems but at least they are more modular then jQuery. (You don't really use more then 50% of jQuery)
You have a problem with using a node.js tool? I'd make sense for javascript tools to be written ontop of node.js.
Sorry, I don't like jQuery. And I've made the effort to solve the problem jQuery solves in a better manner using my own library. So it makes sense to me that my library is a better alternative. It's not about self promoting, it's about showing people what I fill the jQuery gap with.
It's hard to believe that you've been coding for 30 years when you're not even acting 30 years old. Grow up, really.
Fair enough.
No, I just see it as novel and trendy. Not saying it's silly or not useful or anything, I think it's pretty cool but I think it needs to mature more. I commented that because it seems like r/javascript's answer to 90% of the problems out there either suggest micros or Node.
Well for my team we're a small team, we precompile our codes before deployment so yeah, we're used to doing a little manual stuff lol. But I agree, it is supposed to be automated, and we are building towards that. But then, we are using Node.js as our backend already, so I guess we have a little less problem compared to you guys as you guys are using a LAMP stack right? If you want to start using Node.js, try installing a copy on your own machine. Then start playing with Express or Zappa. You should take a look at CoffeeScript as well. But then this thread is about jQuery, frontend Javascript. :P
You don't need nodejs running as a server to run the optimizer. It can be used to just run a script. Treat the optimizer the way you would any script you were given, be it in python, ruby, or shell.
You're entitled to your opinions, but I would like to point out that many criticisms towards jQuery claim that it invariably leads to poor code structure/architecture (I think you basically hinted at this recently?), and these are from some of jQuery's harshest critics, the ones that, like yourself, hate it (which has always been strange to me; I can see disliking it or even maybe despising it somewhat, but it seems that you have a genuine hate for jQuery, like it killed your dog or something). You talk about MVC/OO as if it's absurd, and perhaps to you it is, but you should realize that there's distinct reasons that libs/frameworks like Backbone, Spine, and Knockout exist for MVC, and that Prototype, MooTools, YUI, and ExtJS all implement varying levels of OO. Criticize proven design patterns all you want, but people are using these concepts and demand it from their tools. And as I said in a previous post, I already know JS, I have nothing to prove and therefore I don't feel the need to reinvent everything that I use. To that point, just because I choose to use Backbone doesn't mean that I don't "know javascript" any more than using ExtJS proves that I don't "know javascript". p.s. being a fan of Node and therefore git/github, you could always roll your own jQuery and compile from their source; there _are_ over 18 different, modular scripts. I haven't actually attempted this, though.
&gt; Just pointing out that devs have been asking for enterprise-level help with jQuery (such as OO and/or MVC structure and functionality) To be fair, that's not an entirely rational request. The things you mention are definitely good, but they fall outside the domain of what jQuery is for. jQuery is a utility library largely focused on the DOM, AJAX, and animation. Promises were added because they are very useful for flow control in these areas (though obviously they could be used elsewhere as well). OOP/MVC are things that you should layer on top of jQuery (which is indeed what some frameworks do). &gt;hat many criticisms towards jQuery claim that it invariably leads to poor code structure/architecture I agree with this partially. I think people who use jQuery often end up with terrible code, but it's not something you can blame on jQuery per se. It's a combination of a few things: - jQuery makes certain things very easy, so newbies have a habit of just hammering a problem over the head with jQuery until they get something that works, rather than taking the time to design it properly. - Chaining: abuse of chaining and/or not understanding it. - Callbacks: see chaining. - Not understanding what jQuery is for or it's limits. As mentioned, jQuery has somewhat specific design goals/limits. Really what it is for is adding some relatively light scripting/interaction to a web-page. Once you start heading into web-app territory you're going to either need something more fully featured like DOJO, YUI, etc ...or you're going to have to add another layer on top of jQuery to provide the needed functionality. So you have newbies writing what is really a web-app with just jQuery which ends up creating a mess of callbacks; with program logic, display code, etc all very inter-twined in a poorly designed heap of spaghetti code. - Part of it is certainly that jQuery is the most popular library at this point in time, so it has the most newbies/people who don't know what they are doing. Someone new to JavaScript will mostly likely have heard a lot about jQuery...when asked what library they should use they are most likely to be told "jQuery"...or they will reach for it themselves reasoning that it's the most popular. More obscure libraries are generally only reached for by more experienced users, or at least have less newbies using them (though obviously they still have some). None of this is to say that jQuery is perfect. It certainly has a lot of questionable design decisions/drawbacks...but I don't think you can really blame **all** of the bad jQuery code on jQuery itself. I'd say there's a rough hierarchy (if you want to use jQuery that is, all of these could be done without it): - *Simple Web-Page*: use jQuery to add light interaction/animation. Say a navigation menu. - *Some Functionality embedded in Web-Page*: jQuery + plugins, or something like Amplify.js. Say you have some interactive graphs/charts as part of your content. - *Webapp*: jQuery + jQuery UI + something like BackBone, or other framework. There's no content really, the purpose of the page is some sort of application: the stereotypical example would be Gmail.
Eh. As long as it's mostly syntactic sugar I don't think it's a big deal, but we certainly could be directing the effort to more productive things.
I'm upvoting because this is a good topic for discussion, not because I agree.
What tools do you use to make the work less haunting?
I'm in agreement with much of what you say, except that I think baking in some Backbone-ish functionality is going to happen sooner or later, or at least should; for example, you say: &gt; Promises were added because they are very useful for flow control in these areas (though obviously they could be used elsewhere as well). What about, and I'm going to use Backbone as the example since I know it best... * Router/History: as you admitted earlier (and as jQuery advertises itself), jQuery is an AJAX lib., and though 'routing' is a new-ish concept to JS, it's been around awhile. Seasoned devs know the pattern and how to leverage it. Also, one of the earliest popular jQuery plugins written by one of the jQuery devs was a history/state manager. * Views/Models/Templates: Possibly one of the most popular categories for jQuery plugins, and the vast outbreak of micros in this department, are showing that templating, especially with things like MVVM (I hate whoever names things at MS) is very, very popular in the greater JS community. These things are also heavily tied to AJAX and DOM manipulation, or at least are commonly all found together. * Collections: this is at the core of everything jQuery does, with a majority of the API written to work on collections and not just singular objects. Most of the rest of the Backbone API is already covered by jQuery. Perhaps I'm _missing it_, but I'd rather see _any_ of those features before something as obtuse as promises.
How is a 30 year old supposed to act? Like a pushover? No. You are wrong, you won't admit it and that makes you more immature than anything I've said. You can't or won't tell a lie from the truth. The title is wrong, it does a disservice to javascript, and you won't stop going on about how I didn't read the article. The fact is that upgrading javascript is IMPOSSIBLE in the context of this article, what actually happened is that an update to jquery broke their system, and for some reason you just can't realize that FACT. Who needs to grow up here? Sorry I hurt your feelings by calling you names, that's a cultural difference, but there is another difference being shown here and that is between the truth and a lie. Testing is irrelevant, completely. Testing would have caught jquery breaking their system, but it has nothing to do with the fact that it says on the top of their article that "javascript upgrade brought down our commenting platform", which is a completely and absolutely false statement. upgrading jquery !== upgrading javascript . 
Yes. Promises are from the 1970s, and are found in asynchronous APIs for many languages. That includes old languages and ugly languages as well as more elegant languages. Promises can be used along with classical OO. (java.util.concurrent.Future, anyone?) Saying that promises are something for the "cool kids" is ignorant and just plain wrong.
Sadly the best I have managed (aside from something like alert('wtf?! foo = ' + foo + '?!'); ) is to use the [IE Dev Toolbar.](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=18359) to make changes and see how that affects things. Then I can at least try to get a hint as to where the problem may lie. That and defensive tactics like "read everything I can about javascript and its quirks" and "read everything I can about IE6 and its quirks". And Stackoverflow. Also booze. *Oh, I also sometimes find use for [Debug Bar](http://www.debugbar.com/) and on occasion [IETester](http://www.my-debugbar.com/wiki/IETester/HomePage). Though really, after a while you kind of start to know that things like the javascript time picker you **know for certain** is there is simply hidden off screen because of some positioning quirk (and that, in turn is likely caused by the way some offset is being calculated).
Have you incorporated it into an automated build process? The documentation mentions setting up something with node's watchFile, but I'm unfamiliar with that. I do understand what you mean about running the optimizer like a script (same as yuicompressor). Perhaps I was mistaken in it's operation. For some reason I thought that a request would come into require.js, which then would build from your main.js (pulling in jQuery, deps, and site specific scripts) and then optimizing it and punching out that optimized file to the returned .js file. How would I go about automating the build process, if it is not handled "automatically" via requirejs with the optimize flag turned on?
You... use a debugger, right?
Thanks. In the short term if requirejs ends up being better than yepnope for us, even with manual builds, I'll deploy that. I was hoping the full optimization could be automated so we can develop the source files in place, swap in new versions as they come out, etc, and not have to worry about running some sort of compile. I still have to figure out how to get node running on our lamp stack, yes. My only issue is that it's running Debian Lenny, so I can't use the package manager and it is not a good idea to install the headers and compliers on a production machine to compile node. Guess I have to clone the instance to compile a .deb and then copy over and install that. Thanks for the tips on Express and Zappa. I'll have to read up on them. I also don't quite understand CoffeeeScript. I see it is less code, but I don't really follow the reason for another abstraction.
In Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Opera I do. If you have a good one for IE6 lay it on me (a good one aside from Fiddler... I use that too, almost forgot).
How does it compare to the plurality of Firefox? To my untrained eye, Firefox's looks worse. You have to contend with 3.6, 4, 5, 6, and 7, whereas in IE you have to contend with 6, 7, 8, and 9. http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2011/11/the-end-of-an-era-internet-explorer-drops-below-50-percent-of-web-usage.ars Is the answer, "Well, Firefox makes fewer changes between versions, so even though there's a greater plurality of Firefox versions, it doesn't count."?
Cultural difference my ass, you're acting the part of a juvenile for any given culture. Who cares if I disagree with you about it? Do you really feel like you're being productive with your time sitting there berating me for this? Do you feel like a big man now?
troll
Awesome,, thanks so very much for taking the time to spell this out for me, it's been more help than you know... For the first time in days I feel like I'm actually *improving* the quality of my code. The distinction between name spacing and (whatever the proper name is for the techinique you've explained to me above is) interests me, I think I need to go play a bit and drop some code through a profiler to see if it makes any difference as well. I can certainly see the benefit of creating a new object though like the "big guys" do, too. I will admit to being a jQuery guy, although it's more for convenience than anything (selectors). I suppose I just need to get off my duff and learn more about mootools and perhaps roll a few of my own complex selectors, to get over it. Thanks again Wolfy!
You're definitely missing it. It doesn't really make sense to me to characterize promises as obtuse, perhaps you'd be kind enough to expand on that. Let me see if I can explain the distinction you're missing. Promises were basically added during a rewrite of the jQuery AJAX code. One way new features get added to jQuery is when jQuery itself consumes it. Promises are fundamental to many of the types of things jQuery does, they are essentially an abstraction around callbacks. Since jQuery itself uses them, it makes sense to expose them...especially since they are so useful and fit so well. Even then, if they weren't used by jQuery itself and didn't fit so tightly, they probably wouldn't be included. Again, jQuery is primarily a DOM, AJAX, and animation library...but keep in mind it is designed to provide useful primitives for these things...not be an everything and the kitchen sink solution. &gt; Router/History: These are at a higher level than anything jQuery provides. jQuery provides an abstraction for AJAX **requests** (promises are part of that)... You're discussing things that are useful in combination with AJAX requests in an AJAX **application**. &gt; Views/Models/Templates Again, beyond the scope of jQuery proper. jQuery provides some basic DOM manipulation tools. Views and Models are part of application design, you want a framework for that. &gt; Collections: this is at the core of everything jQuery does Sure, but jQuery already has a collection API for all the stuff it needs. Generic collections aren't at the heart of jQuery...but DOM collctions etc are. You keep mentioning jQuery plugins, yes that's the point. These are things that are best either as jQuery plugins or as a separate library designed to work with jQuery. That's actually the most desirable outcome. By implementing a core of the basics, it keeps jQuery as small as possible. It also lets the jQuery team focus on doing what they do well. jQuery gives you the simple tools you'll need most often. It's one-size fits all (for the most part). You don't really need to be able to choose a different $().ajax() method...or a different $().css(). Templating is something you might want to choose/change...so is how you do MVC, etc. The whole point is you start with jQuery and build it up as you want/need it. That way works really well. If it was the other way around, it would be much harder. Of course, if that's not what you want...if you want a full framework that does do all that stuff for you, you have plenty of choices. Personally, I use jQuery on most quick/easy projects. When I need to create enterprise level apps, I go to DOJO or YUI. It just seems to me you want jQuery to be something it's not. I appreciate why you want it to be that thing, because that thing is something I myself find very useful....however that's not jQuery's goal and I don't think it will be anytime soon. With projects like jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile, they are heading in the direction of providing an additional tool(s) like that...but I believe there will always be a jQuery core like we have today.
Nice, very nice!
It boggles my mind how people can be so vehemently opposed to jQuery. I've been using it for years and find it to be a fantastic library. Of course it has its faults; it would be foolish to assume that a library as enormous and ubiquitous as jQuery WOULDN'T have any. And yes, I'm sure writing your own library would probably be a preferred solution for those with the time and inclination. But the fact of the matter is this: not a single microframework or set of micro-libraries out there is even as REMOTELY well-documented or widely-used as jQuery is. What does this mean? It means no one is going to use your fucking alternative, because no one fucking understands it nor has the time to understand it. I'm all about building better alternatives. More power to you if you're the type of person creating these solutions. But you have to realize that for those of us who spend our time creating and shipping actual applications, we have to prioritize, and writing our own library or learning a new one to save 20k on bandwidth and obtain more JS street cred isn't high on the list. *edit - Oh, and to your bullet point: "infinite amounts of pain when they don't work (and anybody who tells me that selectors and especially effects are stable and cross platform is just so full of BS that it's not even funny)" What? I've produced dozens and dozens of sites/applications using any number of cryptic, mind-bending combinations of selectors and/or effects and never had a single issue (that I can recall) with any of them NOT being cross-platform... Can you provide some sort of example? In my eyes, if the resultant jQuery you're producing doesn't immediately strike a visual parallel to vanilla JS, you're fucking doing it wrong. The entire fucking backbone of jQuery itself is to be used for its awesome cross-browser, cross-language compatibility. Everything else is just icing on the cake.
I find this really, really cool. I actually found it quite well-explained on the github and website as well, so not sure what grayvedigga is talking about.
I've got a great example: I recently had to develop a website for a 'major' film release. It was originally going to be developed in flash, due to the ability to maintain a strong, 'slick' aesthetic - fading elements, graphics being animated across the page, roll-over graphics on everything. I showed that I could do something equally as good with HTML and jQuery, and I ended up building the entire thing with cross-browser HTML. Trying to get the site working across multiple browsers and devices with the same amount of DOM animation etc without jQuery would have been almost impossible.
The callbacks and event toggles were two features I've been hanging out for in 1.7. Whenever there's a new release, I look at the feature list and think "Damn. That would've saved me hours of time"
Sorry, I've just discovered the reddit notification system, ergo just see your comment. You're right, but who uses Firefox/IE nowadays? ;)
Haven't deployed it yet. An automated process is in the works for sure though. How would you automate any build system? Buildbot or Watson or take your pick. I wrapped the command in a Makefile and just run "make deploy" when appropriate.
Yes it is. But the conclusions don't seem to change, do they ?
I suppose that when Opera compiles */generate Lorem Ipsum which looks/* they build the matcher whereas *"generate Lorem Ipsum which looks"* is just a string. It's like having a function hard-coded for a specific recognition versus a generic one. But that still seems to be a beautiful feat.
Isn't it simply that *new RegExp(anystringgivenduringexecution)* is different from */hardcodedstring/*, the second case being compilable with the javascript code ?
for absolute beginner try google
Hey hey, I worked through the whole web 2.0 era too :?. While I agree to an extent with a portion of what you are saying (I like to play devils advocate) I see nothing wrong with NodeJS.
Well good on you sticking with html/css/js rather than depending on Flash.
Upvote for [Lenna (nsfw)](http://www.lenna.org/full/l_hires.jpg).
I believe the generally accepted terms for || and &amp;&amp; in this context is *default* and *guard*. For conciseness and googleability, the blog author should have defined these terms.
In Firefox and IE 9, using the '===' makes the [if _much_ faster](http://jsperf.com/or-versus-if/3).
Worked on iPhone4s didn't work on Droid 2. Pretty cool though.
Nice...where can I see a quick demo (without downloading code..?)
Bit.ly? Really? 
 &gt; By parsing those simple selectors in JavaScript at the time the event was attached, we were able to outperform even the browser’s native-code implementations of matchesSelector during event delivery. Let me get this straight. "those simple selectors" mean `a.add` in the following code and not `.comment`? $('.comment').delegate('a.add', 'click', addNew); $('.comment').on('click', 'a.add', addNew); 
Will need to set that up, gimme a hour or two.. =)
Check out jsgrowl as well: https://github.com/rdejuana/jsGrowl
Okay here we go, try this URL: http://opensource.srirangan.net/notifier.js/ (Hopefully the DNS is resolved for you, else try a bit later!)
I was about to ask the same, it's kind of silly to have code that is so easily demonstrable, and then not demonstrate it....but you're on it! Hopefully you'll include a couple different examples?
Nice! Very similar to jGrowl...
Since you're posting here, I'm assuming that you're open to feedback regarding the script? If not, disregard the rest of this :) * You should wrap your code in an immediately-invoked function expression: `(function(){ /* your code here */ })();` As-is, you're creating more global vars than you should be. * The `notificationsContainer` should be a variable, or should not use an ID, because "notificationsContainer" isn't exactly a very unique ID, and it's very possible existing code might have the same ID. On a similar note, your CSS classes are also very generic (`title`, `icon`, `messages`, etc.) and likely to already be used. You handle this problem well for the individual messages ID's though... * You hard-code the onclick handler directly in the HTML attribute -- this is very backwards! You should use `.click()` from jQuery to assign even handlers... * When you call `setTimeout()`, you usually want to use a function instead of passing in a string (which is treated like an `eval()`); for example.... Instead of: setTimeout("$('#" + id + "').fadeOut()", timeOut); This is usually preferred: setTimeout(function(){ $('#' + id).fadeOut(); }, timeOut); * Generally, people like options! Something that I think some people might would like to set defaults for: the timeout, the title, and the location of the icons and/or changing icons on a one-off basis. While you do expose the generic `Notifier.notify()`, there doesn't look to be a way for me to set the default timeout for _all_ of them at once to say, 15 seconds. I also wouldn't be able to use the specific methods, I'd have to use `Notifier.notify()`. All-in-all, not bad at all though! EDIT: The only actual feature request that I would have would be to be able to add a click event to be run when the notification is clicked on. I might want to navigate the user to a specific page, or open a set of options, etc.
You should allow people to specify what area of the screen to alert at. I usually prefer the lower right. Also (ignore this if you aren't OCD about filespace) you can do &lt;img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANS..." /&gt; for the notification icons. This will get rid of the flicker and also remove the need for any files to be hosted on the server. I would recommend moving the css into the javascript file too.
Yes, I was considering using jsGrowl but a few reason why I chose to write my own: 1. I need to support only Jquery, support for other libs (prototype, scriptaculous etc.) is not required / hence bloat; 2. I believe four types of notifs (success, info, warnings and errors) would be used most often, and I want good support (icons, styling etc) by default for these. 3. I'm not a fan of "close" icons on the top right. Click should be enough.
TIL....thanks for the insight!
I'm failing to make sense of what was posted; care to provide some context?
Feedback is very much appreciated. Regarding #1 and #4, I've already received and merged pull requests. I wasn't aware of this and its good to learn. #2 is a fair point and needs to be looked into. Regarding #3 I don't understand why JQuery event binding should be used over onclick. What would the advantages be? Saying its "very backward" doesn't explain why it should not be used. Completely agree with #5 as well. This should be configurable globally and I see this evolving in that direction. Click event makes sense as well. Lots of good ideas and I can see Notifier.js evolving further. Thanks!
Actually, there are a lot of similar libs - [jsMessage](http://dhtmlx.github.com/message/), [HumaneJS](http://wavded.github.com/humane-js/)
So how many different ways can we attach a click event handler now? `on`, `bind`, `click`, `delegate`, `live`.. oh my!
Awesome! Re: #3....I think it's a 'best practice' to not assign events via HTML attributes. For example, using one of jQuery's many binding methods (`click()`, etc.), you can easily add/remove handlers, which lets you programmatically control the handlers in a much saner fashion. For instance, you can easily add a 2nd click event handler using `.click()`, but using HTML attributes, this becomes very tricky. Not saying it's terrible or that it won't work, just that there's reasons that [jQuery provides so many ways to attach events](http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/lzf65/jquery_raquo_jquery_17_released/c2x1dxn).
Thanks for the feedback, valid ideas going forward.
I don't actually hate jQuery. I do dislike some of community attitude. I have respect for the jQuery developers and core team, because they know what they are doing. I can see good reason for OO libraries with ES3 (prototype, mootools, etc) but you don't need anymore for ES5. I can also see good reasons for MVC libraries (backbone, spine) etc. because they write the architecture of your application for you. There is nothing wrong with these libraries, they are good libraries. It's just they need to stay seperate from jQuery and your other libraries. I'd actually agree there is nothing wrong with using these abstractions if you "know javascript", mind you our definitions of "know javascript" may differ.
Very cool, I love the premise can't wait to play more.
&gt; I'm not a fan of "close" icons on the top right. Click should be enough. Just a suggestion: I wrote a library just like this for use in my Reddit-related browser extension, and I agreed with you on this.. until I found that I wanted to sometimes put links or buttons people could click inside notifications... You might want to make this an option in your library... for some people, clicking anything on the notification should close it... others may want a close button because they want "active" content in those notifications.. Just a thought.. either way, nice job!
That's good to hear, I think the other guy I referenced actually does hate the jQuery project and it's team, and I know that he doesn't respect their abilities. I agree, ES5 is marginalizing many of these idioms that have existed external to JS for some time. Also, it's not so much that I think jQuery _should_ have all of this stuff, because I agree, some of it rather tangential to the core of what jQuery does, but I was contrasting it to some of the other "features" that have been added lately that -- to me -- don't provide near the usefulness as some of these other concepts. I would also make the argument that MVC functionality is much more crucial to modern web-app development than the animation crap that jQuery provides. There is a non-trivial mass of code devoted to animation in jQuery, and I can honestly say that I really don't use any of it. While I've used things like `fadeOut` before, if I'm going to be any real animation at all, I'm using a real GUI lib/framework. I think animations are a thing of Web 2.0 that needs to go away, at least at a core level, but that's just my opinion (obviousy); animations are rarely essential, typically buggy (especially across browsers), and many times add no real value to the application. On top of all that, there's jQueryUI -- so it seems wholly redundant to have UI code in jQuery core when there's also a separate project for such code.
At least you can now re-use the code with node.js because `on` works in node.
But jQuery is all about mindlessly spicing up your website with useless animations! If you remove animations then all that's left is cross browser DOM/Events/Ajax. And that would just be too much of a boring sensible library. But please do raise a bug saying "remove jQuery animation junk into the jQuery UI project"
Cool Game :) Like the minecraft background!
Hi I'm @soyjavi (author of @lungojs): You can already download version 1.0.0 in http://www.lungojs.com/ and fork me on https://github.com/TapQuo/Lungo.js 
an easy way to use HTML5 javascript api... looks good!! easy for a non javascript expert developer..
Considering how little you actually use jQuery in the script it might be worth attempting to remove the dependency. 
It's injecting a script, otracking.com/js/TrackingV2.js , with the appropriate protocol (http/https, depending on what the user is using when visiting the website), and the trackCid/Tid variables are most likely just tracking ID's used inside that script.
Code you pasted adds the external script from otracking.com (as you rightly mentioned). The other one is a minified version of some script. It's done to keep download time short or to obfuscate it for other developers couldn't read it and understand it. Hopefully the first option wins. As for my skills it's gonna be impossible to read it. But maybe someone have some methods - would be interesting to read.
Another suggestion: preload the images. I open your demo for the first time, and the icons in the notifications appear after the notification
Actually, with that's happening in the setTimeout, I think it'd be better served by just using $('#'+id).delay(timeOut).fadeout(callback); and not need to use setTimeout (and its implicit eval) at all. You're already using jQuery for effect, so you might as well buy in and let it do its thing with abstracting away setTimeout safely, since you don't actually need the timeout, you just need to delay execution of an effect.
I'm a huge fan of .live() when having to constantly add/remove things to the DOM. It adds a level of simplicity to the code that makes me tickled inside.
As others have mentioned, it is injecting a tracking script from otracking.com. The script itself cleans up and deobfuscates nicely in [jsbeautifier.org](http://jsbeautifier.org), see the result [here](http://pastebin.com/kzP2x4mi). Just a quick overview, it seems to be doing: * Browser detection * ShockWave Flash detection * It adds an onclick event handler to every link on the page which sends lots of information back to their server by creating an 'image' with a long query string. * It also creates one of these tracking images when the script is loaded. * It does seem to create cookies. If you want to see exactly what cookies it creates, use Chrome's Developer Tools, or FireFox's Firebug, or whatever your browser's equivalent is.
I will probably fork it and do that, as I have a need for the library but prefer to not take on the jQuery dependency. Good work, Srirangan!
Take a look at Jasmine's (BDD unit testing framework) documentation. The explanations of implementation do pretty well at describing how unit testing works. https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/wiki
I second this. I use Jasmine for my own projects.
I have experience with the previously mentioned Jasmine and [YUI Test](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuitest/) as well. Both have a similar functionality set and are well suited to the task, though if you aren't using YUI I'd recommend Jasmine. Basically, a test has a setup which creates the object being tested, a test for that object, and a tear-down which cleans up the objects that were tested. Here's a sample of one passing and one failing test in Jasmine: http://humblesoftware.github.com/js-imagediff/test.html (note the test itself is defined here: http://humblesoftware.github.com/js-imagediff/js/test.js). The most important wisdom I can pass on regarding testing: **automate your tests**. Tests that are not automatic *will* *not* be maintained and will quickly become outdated. To automate tests, integrate your test suite with your build process or set up a continuous integration environment. 
Nope. (In modern browsers) both create a RegExp object which is (usually) compiled to native code. After creation they will perform identically, the only difference would be in the process of creation (like exactly when they are compiled). The test here is concerned with the speed of the actual matching of a RegExp object. All the timed tests run the same setup code, so the possibility of creating the RegExp object a little faster is tangential...(though due to the nature of the test, it'd be impossible without changing the test somewhat).
Another fair point! Thanks!
Unit tests are fairly simple. You write some code. That code should behave in a certain way based on certain input. If it doesn't, that means something is wrong. So you write a series of tests so that you can determine that your code is working. It's useful for a few things. One is test-driven development. Sometimes (but not always) I find it helpful to write the unit tests first, and then code until I have something that passes them. This encourages you to code to the requirements. Another is just to save time. Integrate the unit tests into your build process. A lot of times changing one feature can break others. So, every time you make a relatively big change (like say when you commit), you run the tests to make sure you didn't break anything. To get into unit tests, I recommend [QUnit](https://github.com/jquery/qunit) It's very simple and easy. (note: you don't need to use jQuery to use it) Here's an example. You have some code: (function (global, undefined) { // obviously contrived function function upper ( str ) { return str.toUpperCase(); } // export global.myApp = { upper : upper } })(window); ^ That lives in myApp.js. For my projects, in my repo for the app I have a directory called "tests". In that directory I unzip the QUnit framework, which is basically an HTML file and some JS files. In the HTML file, you include the QUnit js file, along with any other JS files you need, and a JS file that includes your tests. In the test JS file you have tests like: // Separate tests into modules module("String Functions"); test("Test Upper function", function() { var value = myApp.upper( "Hello" ); equal( value, "HELLO", "Uppercase 'Hello' should be 'HELLO'." ); }); When you open the QUnit html file, it will run all your tests and generate a nice little report with whether they pass or fail. I have a line in my build that opens a browser to the page. I use QUnit mostly for simple libraries, some DOM scripting, etc. It's also a nice introduction to to JS testing, For more complicated and behavior driven tests, I recommend Jasmine.
Third vote for Jasmine. Jasmine is simple, straightforward, works well. Make sure to read up on spyOn(), Jasmine's way of doing mocks and stubs. The most annoying part of JS testing, for me, was overcomplicating it at first. I'm still a TDD noob, but I found I had much more success when I broke testing into two categories: **Unit tests**, which test each method of your program individually. Unit tests can verify that a method works the way you want, and performs correctly with boundary conditions (when passed crazy numbers, bad values, etc). They also encourage you to write much shorter, more precise methods. There's a lot to read about unit testing, but in my experience, it's important to only test _one method at a time_ — if your method requires the results of other methods, or even DOM interactions, consider replacing these with mocks or stubs. For example, if I have a method like: init : function(){ this.getDomElements(); this.bindEvents(); this.showControls(); } ...I wouldn't want my "init" unit test to test that each one of these methods operates correctly. Instead, I would mock them, like so, and just check that they're actually called: it('inits the feature', function(){ spyOn(feature, 'getDomElements'); spyOn(feature, 'bindEvents'); spyOn(feature, 'getControls'); feature.init(); expect(feature.getDomElements).toHaveBeenCalled(); expect(feature.bindEvents).toHaveBeenCalled(); expect(feature.showControls).toHaveBeenCalled(); }); This is much faster, and more precise, than testing for the actual results of all three methods. Of course, each of these three methods would have their own tests later, but that doesn't concern me here — in this case, I just want to know that "init" does what it needs to, even if "getDomElements" is totally broken. **Integration tests**. With JS, once you're 100% sure your code is operating correctly, you often have other problems — weird user interactions, bad browser support for features, even CSS changes can cause your JS to fail. Integration testing is outside-in testing for these kinds of issues. Int tests don't ask "does method X return true?", but "when I poke the button, does the button turn green?" In my experience, you can write an _infinite_ number of int tests — there's no logical stopping point like there is with units. Usually, though, I just write a barebones set that verifies DOM interactions are occurring correctly. Example: it('shows the overlay when the button is clicked', function(){ expect($('.overlay').is(':visible')).toEqual(false); $('.button').click(); expect($('.overlay').is(':visible')).toEqual(true); } This seems like a dumb test, but it's valuable once you have a large site with a ton of interactions. New code can break old code without your knowledge, and you won't have the time (or memory) to go test every feature and see what's failing. Automating int tests gives you some added confidence that yes, things still work the way you want. You can get by with very few int tests at the beginning, since you and your users will be doing this sort of testing live anyway. The cool part is that when you come across a really rare or screwy bug, you can write a new int test for it, fix it, and then be sure that you've pinned it down _forever_. Your int tests will continue checking it, so you don't have to worry about accidentally reintroducing it down the road. Anyway, that's all I know so far — still learning a lot about TDD. Hope it's helpful.
If I embed notification icons as you suggested, will it break in any major browser? 
I'd let the jQuery dependency stay. Its being heavily used in the refactored version 2 of this tool. =) I'm getting rid of the .css file and if possible the .png files.
I'm reading this on a phone, cannot open and view the source. What does notifier *do*? It appears to pop up a notification window or div? Is that only with an explicit call? Is there some async notification possible, like a publish/ subscribe model? (assume i know nothing about jGrowl, because ....ah.... I know nothing about jGrowl)
This is awesome to see. Looking forward to using Notifier.
I couldn't find this on the website or GitHub repo: what browsers are supported? Obviously I mean which versions of Internet Explorer...
It uses Jquery, so I'd assume any browser that Jquery supports. Jquery supports IE6.0+.
I like Block UI Better, sorry ^_^
Oh.. The purposes of Notifier.js and Block UI are very different. The purpose of Notifier.js is to provide unobtrusive, non-blocking, minimalist notifications. Block UI blocks. Provides dialogs, confirmations and a whole heap of features (or bloat depending on your personal slant).
IMO you should have jQuery be optional. I never use jQuery so it should fallback to something else (probably just the code you had before) for those that like to keep it lightweight
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme#Web_browser_support If you want to support older browsers you can use stuff from https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-Browser-Polyfills
Hmm.. you may have a fair point. However all my projects already depend on jQuery so having a lite, jQuery free version of Notifier.js is not really a priority. However feel free to fork / branch it. I do think having a lite, jQuery free offering of Notifier.js will really help in adoption.
It uses data URIs for the icons so nothing less than IE8.
Shucks, this is the kind of thing that makes it less desirable. I would be okay if only the icons didn't show up, but I prefer to have a statement on the project homepage listing the compatibility issues so I don't have to worry about this kind of mystery stuff...
Point noted. I'll list browser compatibility in the readme file. I think the time has come to stop developing for anything less that IE8.
Is there an online demo where I can test this? Something similar to the [JQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0b1/) and [Sencha Touch](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/demos/) demo pages would be a great motivator for using LungoJS.
My suggestion is to take the styles out of the script. Styling should be the responsibility of users of the script to implement -- indeed, anyone using this script will most likely need to revise the styling pieces -- even the nice images and data uri pieces you've got there. You could move those styles to your example file and reference them by a class. This also brings credit to being 'lightweight'. Where currently -- your script is encountered, appends a div to the body of the page and applies default styles... for me, the script has already done too much -- I might want these notifications going someplace other than on the BODY -- maybe nested somewhere on my page. Perhaps initialization should be handled by a javascript call from the developer using your script, in their document.ready call.... you could make this a jquery plugin so you could call your script like ... $("#my-notification-container-div").notifize({ itemClass : 'item' }); This would associate the div as the notification container, and sets up the class to be used as 'item' ... this raises a few interesting issues, like what happens if it gets called more than once.... I guess you would have to decide what the most 'light-weight' thing would be to do... Also you could accept other global-type parameters here like the timeout. anyway, your CSS would look like so: .item{ padding:12px 18px; margin:0 0 6px 0; background-color:#000; opacity: 0.8; color:#fff; font:normal 13px 'Droid Sans', sans-serif; border-radius: 3px; boxShadow: #999 0 0 12px; width:300px; } .item:hover{ opacity: 1; box-shadow:#000 0 0 12px; } .info{ } .warning{ } .error { } .success{ } I do have the info/warning as classes in there -- these might be parameters, I dunno... I'd style them as DIV with a background image instead of as an image to keep it as straight CSS .... also if someone doesn't like using data uris for their IE support issues, they could always use their own styles and reference their own background images on file... This would be cool though -- if your script could register different types of notifications with the associated styling details/class -- this would return a function that could later be called to add the items... and also could attach it to your window object for ease of calling, Something like this: var x = $.fn.notifize.register( "newType", "my-type-class"); x( "title", "message" ); // if saved for later Notifier.newType( "title", "message" ) // for ease of calling 
Not sure if this was mentioned in your other thread, but it would be great if you preloaded the images so they don't flicker the first time they are loaded. 
Dude - I'm so glad you took that constructive criticism and expanded on it. Nicely done.
Altruistically, that's true. Realistically, it's not time. While we'd all *love* to be able to ditch IE6/7, they still have a significant enough piece of the pie in browser usage that can't be ignored. The best practice is to degrade gracefully. You could either opt to non data URIs or simply degrade (gracefully) so that IE doesn't show a big empty red X - ie., no icons.
Yes, you have te &lt;code&gt; in Github https://github.com/TapQuo/Lungo.js In examples folder :)
Hi, Whilst ditching support for IE6/7 may be tempting, just remember that many users still use this browser, maybe give them a super cut down version or something instead? I'll still be using this as a nice little addon for my system, because all IE6/IE7 users deserve my hate.
First of all, thanks for the detailed feedback. Your point about BODY not always being the container for notifications is valid and well taken. This can and probably should be exposed via configuration with the default value being BODY. If you look at some of the earlier revisions of Notifier.js, it was close to what you described. There was an external style sheet, styles through class names, external icon images etc. The external style sheet and icon images were deliberately gotten rid off, in an attempt to simplify usage of this library and to achieve the pre-loading of icons. I agree that styles may be modified very often, which is why they are exposed through configuration. And the default dark style will work for many color schemes. --- Apart from that, in principle, I am probably against making things too customizable for example allowing nodes / elements to be transformed into notifications / alerts / dialogs etc. This isn't a general purpose library for dialogs, confirmation, alerts etc. It has a very specific mandate to provide unobtrusive, non-blocking notifications and no more. There are many others, for example Block UI as mentioned by compubomb, that are better integrated with jQuery and more customizable in general.
For the default icons (info, warnings, success, errors) there will be no flicker. For custom icons, pre-loading hasn't been done.
This is ridiculous! Uses a lot of CPU power, but I suppose that's to be expected.
It really performs best in Chrome. (I get ~30fps on an i3) Tip of the trunk contains a few more optimizations but the demo isn't as flashy.
I was going to ask a similar question, which is this: how is LungoJS different from jQuery Mobile and jQTouch (Sencha Touch)?
any chance you can put this on the official site, so it is possible to test it from a mobile device without downloading and implementing it from github?
IE share is 90% in China, IE6 passed IE7 just a few months ago, too. FF &amp; Chrome together are less than 10%.
IE7 does. IE6 has dropped a lot though, it's around the same percentage as Opera. Not many people test Opera. http://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php
[Microsoft is doing it for you.](http://www.ie6countdown.com/), and why the heck is China ~ 25% usage. Yuck.
So I guess checking IE6 would only matter if you're developing a website where you have a considerable amount of Asian visitors.
it is a [conditional comment](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Conditional_comment#Conditional_comments_in_JScript) used by JScript.
Next week we will upload the demo.app in LungoJS.com as a Mobile Emulator (I hope). Thanks Sorry for my poor english :(
Badass, congrats!
Well, the main difference is that it uses HTML5 APIs very useful for mobile development: WebSql (SQLite), History, Device Orientation, Geolocation... and offers a powerful Javascript API (http://www.lungojs.com/api/) with many features including: Templates, DataBinding, Cache... Note also that Project is created by 2 maverick kids with current frameworks.
Is this what I'm supposed to be seing? http://i.imgur.com/GLKbX.png I believe I'm getting a x-domain error on the console "Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with URL ...domain and port must match" this is on chrome 16.0.912.21 beta ubuntu 11.10 64bit Do I need to do something to allow cors?
runs flawlessly for me. this is....how...fuck..
Ask Microsoft.
Well, what you see depends on your current location when running the page. Try going to options and select a Far, Quite Far or Really Far and see. Sometimes cities are just too dull in colour. Where are you? The error message sounds like you are inside some frame, but your snapshot shows that your browser is being able to read pixels from the map tiles. CORS is something that has to be enabled on the server, for the resource you want the browser to be able to use. The browser, of course, has to support CORS resouces. There's more info [here](http://www.enable-cors.org/).
Thanks. A lot of credit goes to gaiaap for his optimizations. My hope is that someone picks this up and makes a cool game with it.
ah, the answer is yes, however at the default distance and size, it was just appearing to be random blocks. adjusting that made it much more evident what was going on. It felt like I was missing something but now it is obvious: http://i.imgur.com/2oREo.jpg
Yes, for most small and medium-sized cities, it's enough to see the surroundings. For other cities, though, you need to zoom out to recognise something.
I've just tried the sample apps and play with it for a couple of hours. It looks pretty neat and as said already it provides the feature of deploy the app via http. Save as webapp in my iphone and done. Just Amazing!
General feedback - Brilliant idea. Specific feedback :) - the interface is a bit confusing. Here's a [screenshot](http://imgur.com/GdaF1) of LA to SF. 1. I'm not sure what the extra points on the map mean. They seem arbitrary. 1. I took this screenshot at 12:30 Pacific, and it's showing me weather points for 2PM and 11PM. Not sure why. Is it showing me there will be rain on that part of the 5 at 11PM? I'll be long past it by then given the 6.5 hour drive time. 1. Hitting enter doesn't submit the form - had to click the Go! Button. 1. I had to refresh the page to enter a second trip. The form seems to disable after the first time you hit Go! Seriously though I think the concept is great, and if you can make the interface friendlier this will be a great tool and I would totally use it. Have you looked around to see if there's already something like it out there? I always to that for "inspiration" for my projects. 
The 1.5MB worth of logos in the corner might be a bit excessive.
Btw if you want a more photorealistic effect, just reduce your font size.
Your code is unreadable, by the way. Next time use pastebin.
1. The extra points on the map are for weather data at the end of the legs that are longer than 50 miles at a stretch. 2. It's supposed to line up the weather data for the time when you pass through it. It appears that my algorithm is a bit off. 3. That's something I've been trying to figure out how to fix. 4. Same as 3 I have not looked yet.
I'm working on scaling the pictures down. I picked just the standard logos and scaled them within the HTML code, but scaling the files down would be better.
Strager. We just let in the first 75 betatesters, where you among them? If not, send me an email at support@muscula.com, and I'll invite you.
Or at least indent everything by 4 spaces.

Try delaying the reloadMarkers call.
You are quite wrong about that. IE6+ support is not that hard for how simplistic this plugin is.
In this case the conditional comment comments out the ! not operator for every client but InternetExplorer, so that isIE is true.
It's a conditional comment. That means it's a regular, ordinary comment, to everyone except IE. IE will input the value inside, in this case the '!'. For example with the line: isIE = (/*@cc_on ! @*/ false); In IE this becomes: isIE = (! false); ... whilst in every other browser you get: isIE = (false); You can also do some more funky stuff, like generate totally different code for each version of IE. However conditional comments should be avoided because they can be stripped out by minifiers (since they look like regular comments), and they are no longer supported in HTML5 pages in Internet Explorer 10. Conditional comments is not how I would do it, but I'd really like an in-built cross-browser JS preprocessor.
I maybe looking at this in a different way. I believe its our job to educate users to migrate to a modern browser. "But what about cases where the organization forces people to use IE6!" Same case. We don't build apps for ancient browsers, and if our app is useful for their business, they must upgrade. Its about time!
That's a novel way of looking at it; but in the real world, big business drives the requirements, not the app driving the browser's application migration. They'll migrate when they can, when it's financially feasible for the roll-out, or when it's absolutely not needed anymore. If it's a web-app, it's probably not a critical app for the big business to continue working - and they most certainly will drive the requirements - otherwise you won't get to make the app for them, and the job will go to someone who *will* work with the big business. It's not lost on *all* businesses that IE6 is dead and it's time to move on. But the world doesn't work like that - it takes money, it takes time, and it takes initiative within the company for it to happen. It will, but it will happen on *their* schedule.
I've worked at enough "real world" large companies to know what you're saying is correct. However, developing for IE6 when __even__ Microsoft asks enterprises to upgrade is a rather unfortunate sustenance of the status-quo.
I'm seeing slight distortion in Firefox, heavier in Chrome/Safari (with the demo), the right border seems wavy.. any idea? Other than that, looks kickass :-)
Hm, so you're on OS X? If you could link me to a screenshot that would help.
Here you go http://mech.cx/var/tmp/asciitracer/ (When I copy/paste the contents in a text editor, they're aligned perfectly fine.)
Yeah I can generate the same effect if I write my data to just a &lt;pre&gt; instead of a &lt;pre&gt; inside a &lt;div&gt; (in windows/linux). Looks kinda cool, actually. I would need an OS X machine to debug this problem. Any os x-running people want to help?
I poked at it with Chrome's inspector, to little avail. It doesn't help that I suck at CSS &gt;.&lt; What would you need? FWIW, it looks fine in Chromium (which I haven't updated for _ages_, looks like, 3.0.184 (184.0)).
Not sure. I would just love to meet someone who has seen this bug before and knows the fix. Surprisingly difficult to google this one.
Hrm. I'll ask around.
http://demos.twilightparadox.com/demos/AsciiTracer/asciitracer.html It's somewhat ironic that the demo itself doesn't use ASCII :).
you got me there ;) [for you other purists](http://budgetairlines.crabdance.com/demos/ascii-tracer/asciitracer.html)
NOD32 isn't liking the demo URL for some reason: http://ss.dan.cx/2011/11/06-23.07.57.png
In Python a variable doesn't exist before you declare it. In JavaScript it does. So to avoid confusion it is a good practice to declare all variables at the top of a function. JavaScript has huge design errors, and to eliminate them (at least partially) Crockford's JSLint defines a proper subset of the language. Personally, when I started to use JSLint my code become much more reliable. And after using it for a while I became to really understand the reasons behind its restrictions. And also "JavaScript: the good parts" made me a much better programmer. His opinions and suggested practices in the book shed light on the nature of Javascript. I disagree with you that his opinions are pedantic and not particularly useful.
Good to know. I'm using afraid.org as my DNS provider for a temporary (free) host name. I guess a lot of malware sites do the same.
It looks like the site has previously had malware on it, though: http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=twilightparadox.com/ Looks like this is why NOD32 is blocking it. EDIT: Disregard, I didn't realise twilightparadox.com was an Afraid.org domain (since NOD32 isn't letting me access the site and I didn't want to turn it off just in case), I thought you just meant it was a personal domain you were using their DNS service with. Carry on.
Closures close upon bindings in scope. js&gt; var fns = []; js&gt; for (var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) { &gt; fns.push(function() { print(i); }); &gt; } 10 js&gt; fns[0](); 10 fns[0] closed over i; not the value of i which was 0 when you did the binding, but i itself. All functions in the array fns closed over same i, and fn[0..9] will be seeing the same i, which is 10 when the loop completed. If this behavior isn't desired, we make copies of `i`. js&gt; var fns = []; js&gt; for (var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) (function(i) { &gt; fns.push(function() { print(i); }); &gt; })(i) js&gt; fns[0](); 0 Function parameters are passed by value, and by passing i as a function parameter, we passed different bindings of i. Here is another example to make the point clear that it closes upon the variable, and not the value. js&gt; function counter(start) { &gt; return function() { return start++ }; &gt; } js&gt; start_at_1 = counter(1); js&gt; start_at_1(); 1 js&gt; start_at_1(); 2 js&gt; start_at_1(); 3 js&gt; start_at_1(); 4 js&gt; start_at_2 = counter(2); js&gt; start_at_2(); 2 js&gt; start_at_2(); 3 js&gt; start_at_2(); 4 
Every function can always access the variables defined in the surrounding scopes, even if it's the private variable of another function, even if that other function has already ended. 
Ahhhh. Now I get it! Thanks very much! The solution the google maps documentation gave was indeed making a seperate function for the event creation.
Unless the function is trivial I usually create a named function something like this: function handlerFor(i) { return function() { return i } } Additionally you might want to check out [John Resig's Advanced JavaScript tutorial](http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/). It's really quick but very informative, and includes this common gotcha.
Looking at the source, I see extensive modification to native prototypes... `Number.include(...)`?!?
A simple, yet completely useless metaphor: A student learns about Ho Chi Minh in school. He comes home, and he still knows about Ho Chi Minh, even though the context he learned in was school. His parents don't know anything about Ho Chi Minh, not even when he is around. If they specifically talk to him about Ho Chi Minh, he can teach them, but his mere presence does not impart them any special access to his knowledge of his school subject.
You can also name closures in the expression form, which is helpful for debugging if nothing else: callMeLater(function aggravateBears(bear) { bear.poke(); }); There are a bunch of changes in ES.next that should help with some of the closure gotchas, like this classic one: array = []; for (var i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) array.push(function () { return i; }); print(array[0]()); // prints 5, not 0 (Though you'd have to explicitly close over an additional lexically-scoped variable or use a different for-head form.)

Forbidden You don't have permission to access /experiments/touch.html on this server. Seems it doesn't like desktop computers.
When locals for a function become available inside a different function, via function call inside the original function. This works for things like setInterval and setTimeout, making life a lot easier.
Hadn't heard of it before, and I'm wondering what's the point? Why this instead of the more popular/supported jQuery?
Looks like it can run in a so-called "safe mode," which I presume means it doesn't mess with those.
http://www.godlikemouse.com/2007/05/09/javascript-execute-scope/ This should help.
Love that you included the icons in the javascript. Smart touch. 
Well, I haven't used this framework myself, but I can say the 'why' looks like it includes more core features that in jquery would need plugins. Yet it still retains a small footprint. And more options is always a good thing in the world of the modern web.
Think of it as a parent child relationship. Child can use variables from the parent and grandparents. Parent can't use variables from child. A Child has a single Parent. A Parent may have multiple children, in most cases those children are clones. You could (and should) think about this as a tree structure. Parent and child bonds are formed via lexical scope. I.e A a function (child) is defined within another function (parent). The child function may get called multiple times with varying arguments but all those "instances"/"clones" of the child share the same parent and thus share the (grand)parents variables.
The author of api that produced that nonsense deserves to be choked. I'd even just prefer you to send me the miliseconds instead of all the constructor nonsense. Seriously that is sofa king brain dead. If only there was a [standard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations) way of representing a date in text format. ...also what makes this a gotcha with JSON specifically? Seems to me just a gotcha with service authors that don't know why we serialize things. oh and one more thing: Date.fromXYZDateFormat = function(jsonDate){ return new Date(jsonDate.match(/[0-9]/)[0])
The point of this article is meant for a popular way of using dates in JSON. I can't tell you how many retail products i've used that format dates like this. So, in my research there hasn't been much talk about how to handle this date format. Yes of course, ISO dates are a standard but it isn't a standard use in JSON data. Yes about the article name-JSON Dates is just one item in the article, since more will be added later. i'm unsure of why you seem so offended by this article, but thanks for your opinion.
you're right though, i should include how to handle ISO dates.
That was a great read. I'm especially horrified by the approach of using [WebGL typed arrays](http://www.khronos.org/registry/typedarray/specs/latest/) and writing JS like it was assembler, but at the same time it's fascinating that it can have such a dramatic effect. And suddenly those fancy demos of mp3 and h264 decoding in pure JS are starting to make more sense. 
I saw this project some time ago, it has promise but the code is still a mess.
You know the really cool thing is, that if you try to send that Date() constructor format BACK to the same .Net webservice, it will fail to parse it into a valid date/time value. Brain Fucking Dead
Yes, yes! Or at least just send me UTC UNIX time in milliseconds (which is easiest to parse in any language, even Brainfuck) if things like timezone, DST, and pre-1980 or non-conventional dates don't really matter.
I think you're thinking of South Korea and [SEED](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEED). In China the banks use ActiveX not for a different cryptosystem but rather for login systems that are (ostensibly) less susceptible to keylogging.
The File API should have [readAsArrayBuffer](http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#dfn-readAsArrayBuffer), which will give you back an [ArrayBuffer](https://www.khronos.org/registry/typedarray/specs/latest/#5), over which you take a [view](https://www.khronos.org/registry/typedarray/specs/latest/#7) to get access to things with the right type definition for your context. Sorry for the links to spec-text; I know it's not really very approachable, but I couldn't quickly find more humane explanations.
I just see a google maps page even after putting in a from and to location and hitting go. Am I missing something?
If you click on the balloons, as well as look under the map, it is designed to show the weather along your planned route. The weather data is added only if the legs are 50 miles or more in distance. Can you attach screenshot or offer the To/From data so I can see what you are seeing?
Not everyone likes jQuery and why not?
Mozilla have some info on [typed arrays and views](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript_typed_arrays).
Closures are a feature of functional programming languages. Understanding what they are is a little easier when you understand why they are important in JavaScript. In functional languages like JavaScript, a function is a primitive. That means that functions can return functions, expressions can evaluate to functions, etc. Just like "String" is a primitive type, so is "function". Got it? Now, in JS, a closure usually is in the form of a named function that returns an anonymous function, which itself returns an object. Sound confusing? Here's an example: var x = function() { return { y: "here's a string", f: function() { console.log("this here is a function"); } }; }(); In the above code, the anonymous function does nothing but return this object with two properties, y and f. But note that x is set to the *returned value of the function*, not to the function itself. So why do we care about closures? In programming, we often want to have control of the scope of a variable. Java, C#, C++ and other similar languages manage scope by introducing the concept of private and public variables. JavaScript does not have the concept of private or public variables. That's not a feature of the language. It does, however, support closures, and it turns out that closures can be a very powerful and useful way to control scope. In the above example, y and f are *scoped within x*. That's called the "closure scope (although it is the same thing as "function scope"... just a difference in terminology).
always being using Jquery, but if this is faster and lighter i will definitively give it a shot. Does anyone has a project using RightJS that could share with us?
it is optional. you can have native extensions or you can use it in a safe mode without them.
Here's an example I had kickin' around: &gt; function Closure() { var closed = 0; this.set = function(n) { closed = n; }; this.get = function() { return closed }; } &gt; var closure = new Closure(); &gt; closed ReferenceError: closed is not defined at [object Context]:1:1 at Interface.&lt;anonymous&gt; (repl.js:179:22) at Interface.emit (events.js:64:17) at Interface._onLine (readline.js:153:10) at Interface._line (readline.js:408:8) at Interface._ttyWrite (readline.js:585:14) at ReadStream.&lt;anonymous&gt; (readline.js:73:12) at ReadStream.emit (events.js:81:20) at ReadStream._emitKey (tty_posix.js:307:10) at ReadStream.onData (tty_posix.js:70:12) &gt; closure.get() 0 You can think of a closure as sort of a "box" defined by the edges of your function definition. Anything outside the box can't reach anything defined inside the box but not returned or passed to it.
Okay, so my question becomes 'why don't people like jQuery?'
Thanks, will look into that!
same reason why people don't like PHP i think :)
Sometimes Chrome is too fast for itself. Use try/catch and access your dependencies to check whether they really are loaded. If they aren't, check again in a few milliseconds.
PHP is a language, jQuery is a library.
Dammit, I clicked 'Delete this entry' again!
He makes a valid point.
I'm just leaving it there as trollbait.
I'm surprised that the difference in speed is so much.
I'm actually not that surprised, because without it the JS runtime has to respect lots of corner cases and JS quirks. For example possible false values include: false, null, undefined, 0, '' and NaN; so you'd need to ensure it is none of those. With ===, your limiting this from 5 possible values to just 1.
jQuery animations are effectively the same thing as jQuery.css, except where they may have optimized with CSS animations, though jQuery would have to load those animation classes into a new stylesheet to make them available. My point here is that no matter the abstraction level, a complete separation of concerns is simply not feasible in a site with a reasonable reliance upon Javascript, and a dogmatic adherence to such a philosophy is largely naive and serves little purpose. Even the author makes exemption for templating libraries, even though that is exactly what the article rails against. The only possible exception here is to store the template outside of Javascript, but that leaves two options: one, have the template stored on every html page where it may be used, causing potentially unnecessary overhead with every page load, or two, load the template via XHR. Clearly neither of these options is as appealing as storing the template in a Javascript file which is then cached by the browser. Use what works. Use the tools available to make your life easier. Do what it takes to get the job done and don't let someone make you feel guilty for not doing it the way they would have.
I'm mainly rallying against inline HTML strings. And I actually disagree, templates through XHR is better because then you dont have to duplicate the template in multiple javascript files. Also javascript animations are bad, that's what CSS3 is for.
&gt;Also javascript animations are bad, that's what CSS3 is for. What about being compatible with older browsers?
I wish I lived in the same world as the author where you always have perfect control over all of your code and how it's used. 
I have to say that I had the same questions even _after_ I browsed the site; they really don't put much effort at all into the actual _why_, as in, _what problems are you solving with this library?_ There isn't much done on the site to promote product differentiation to speak of.
Use arrays and Array.push and Array.join() and not concatenation. function f () { var HTML = []; HTML.push('some html'); HTML.push('more html'); HTML.push('even more'); return HTML.join(''); } Much faster... Of course you can still use concatenation for smaller bits of HTML code, but when building large strings, arrays are the way to go.
Except in IE (at least old versions), where array operations tend to be even more expensive than string ones.
You really should be using client-side templating systems like [Underscore Templates](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/) or [Handlebars.js](http://www.handlebarsjs.com/)... But if you want something minimal, what I do usually is: var tmpl = function (link) { var html = [ "&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;" , link , "&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;" ] return html.join('/n') } 
Why does .NET always have to reinvent the wheel in what is usually the most obtuse way possible? I'm with you, whoever decided that `/Date(1234567890)/` would be acceptable has to be a sadistic "ASP.NET" dev.
Even if you agree with him, wouldn't you agree that the option to turn it off should be included?
Not trying to be a jerk, but this is only true for IE. FF, Chrome, and Safari are all faster at concatenation. Here's a JSPerf for it. There are tons more like it. http://jsperf.com/join-vs-concat2
I would suggest templates. http://microjs.com/#templating Pick what ever you like, but the idea is this: var html = tmpl('&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="{link}"&gt;{link}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;', {link: 'http://reddit.com'});
Yeah that's fine for a building small amounts of HTML. I was referring to building large tables (hundreds of rows with numerous cells), concatenation slows down over time were the array method does not.
It's quicker if the string is just flattened once and not per row. I'm not sure if there are any JS engines which can figure out that flatting the string isn't necessary yet. If you want to keep that function call, the only way to do it is with an array. E.g.: var f = function (a) { a.push( 'foo', ..., 'bar' ); }; (Yes, you can actually push several items in one go.)
What I do is embed the html in the page in a hidden element then grab it with jquery, clone it, and put all of my data in the clone. Then put the cloned html where ever it needs to go. This keeps most of your html in your html page instead of having it in your javascript. You don't need anything like a javascript template system for something like this. HTML: &lt;ul id="list-template" style="display:none;"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; JS: var li = $('#list-template li').clone(); //Add stuff to your li element ... //Put li element where it needs to go $('#real-list').append(li);
Great point. When working with large sets, that totally makes sense. It just seemed like OPs example was pretty small.
yep i definitely agree, seems like everything Microsoft has to go off on their own and create new problems where one didn't exist before.
i have never used the function to send back to the same .NET service, if i needed to, i would use ISO. in fact i avoid .NET services all-together if i can help it. by the way--most of the negative criticism i've gotten over this article has to do with use-cases that are not even covered in the article. ie, returning the parsed date from that format back to a .NET service. I use this function to parse into a Javascript Date object, as was the purpose and point of this article. Maybe you can write an article of your own, explaining away the finer points of your infallible intellect :)
studying up on jquery operations like .append(), .appendTo(), .before(), .after(), .wrap() etc can help make your syntax more terse. so for example: $("&lt;a&gt;").text("some text").wrap("&lt;li&gt;"); would create &lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;some text&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; tersely and legibly. if you're generating big blocks of markup, i second jimdoescode's comment below about .clone()-ing existing blocks in the DOM.
Note working with strings directly is *very* prone to breakage, because you must handle escaping yourself, which most people almost inevitably fail to get right. Another step on the road to using a JS templating library is something like this (with jQuery): &lt;div style="display: none"&gt; &lt;-- hide templates --&gt; &lt;ul id="list_template" some=attrs,etc&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;li id="item_template"&gt; &lt;strong class="index"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class="title"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;script&gt; function cloneTemplate(sel) { var cloned = $(sel).clone(); cloned.removeAttr('id'); return cloned; } $(document).ready(function() { var ul = cloneTemplate('#list_template'); for(var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) { var li = cloneTemplate('#item_template'); $('.text', li).text('Item ' + i); $('.index', li).text(i); li.appendTo(ul); } ul.appendTo('body'); }); &lt;/script&gt; Assuming your 'templating' needs are quite low, you can see here that it's very natural to avoid escaping issues (and all the security problems they introduce.. XSS, etc.). This also avoids including an entire library when all you really want is something simple, while still remaining sufficiently concise enough for regular use (note the flexibility of using "index" and "text" classes to "parameterize" the "template" - a designer can still move the HTML around without breaking the code). This also leverages the optimized native browser code for template parsing, although you're more likely to outgrow this scheme long before using templates complex enough to notice the perf gain.
I would think of it as a DSL.
I agree but would add that when using the template engine of choice that you place the templates into individual script tags. Browsers will not render them if you give them a type they don't know. &lt;script type="html/template" id="foo-template"&gt; ... &lt;/script&gt; Then using it for example with underscore templates and jquery you just grab the interior html. &lt;script&gt; var foo = _.template($('#foo-template').html()); $('body').append(foo()); &lt;/script&gt; Using divs or other elements with display:none should be avoided since they could be lost in other markup or accidentally displayed by an another developer or script on the page.
Trolls baitin' trolls. Legit.
well actually, in chrome the concatenation is still way way faster, even for large data sets. my last run of the js.perf gave me: 868,055,560 vs 2,089,176 if your browser is going to be chrome, go ahead and concat. Edit not sure why downvoted: here is some tests I ran: http://jsperf.com/yet-another-join-vs-concat
remember to remove the style="display:none"; attribute.
I really like Underscore Templates. Thanks!

The best templating library for jQuery is juote2 http://aefxx.com/jquery-plugins/jqote2/ It's tiny, faster than all the others, and fully functional.
I never thought of this. Very nice.
i would advise the google closure templates. super fast compared to any other template library, compiles to both javascript code and java code so you can reuse it on the server (if your stack is inclined that way)
Go away, I'm batin'.
Pastebin is easier.
Don't have to. I am not getting the template I am getting the li element within the template.
I'm not sure I really agree with that approach; it's kind of an abuse of the DOM. It may be better than what the OP has, but I don't think the DOM was meant to act as a repository (unless you're using one of the DOM storage API's).
I don't recommend this approach for large scale templating. In those situations the js template libraries should be used. Those seem like over kill in this situation though. 
screw writing it like you write assembly. use a compiler. closure for javascript to javascript and a llvm compiler for compiling llvm adaptable code to javascript. 
I use this technique with Jade templates. Works very well! I have an init that adds the templates as they are requested to prevent them from showing up in the view-source of the page.
I used this exact approach for a few months assuming - for the same reasons as you - that it'd be fast. Trust me, it's slow as *hell*. I suggest looking at something like John Resig's [Micro-Templating](http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/) instead, which I've found more than adequate (and better than pulling in a big templating library). The way it works also makes precompiling templates into functions server-side trivial. 
http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/
Try [this](http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/). Being only a few lines of code it's small enough to copy into your project and maintain yourself, but it still provides the same template syntax that something like jQote does.
I honestly disagree - while templates are a simple, quick way (innerHTML ftw) to generate the UI, I think that, on the client side, it is a broken idea. It makes sense on the server side, because the server usually does not care about the markup, it's just text that gets sent to the client. But on the client, that is not the case. HTML elements are live objects in the client, and you are really just using text templates as a DSL to create a DOM tree. I think that's a bad way to build DOM trees, because you lock yourself out of the kick-ass solutions that could be built were you to use a programmatic approach to building DOMs. By that I mean that with a programmatic approach, it becomes really easy to build powerful abstractions that include event management and higher level versions of basic HTML objects, that might be very cumbersome with a template based approach. It also becomes an issue of testability - a UI built programatically can easily be mocked out, so that you can unit test logic right below the surface of the UI.
Please people, let's never work with HTML strings like that when constructing elements. Just build the elements using an actual DOM api: function make_element (type, contents) { var elem = document.createElement(type); if (contents != undefined) elem.appendChild(document.createTextNode(contents)); return jQuery(elem); } f(){ return make_element('li') .append(make_element('a', link).attr('href', 'http://google.com')); } 
I would highly recommend [pure](http://beebole.com/pure/). No need to introduce another meta language (ie: templating system). Just place the empty html somewhere in your dom and use it as a template. Pure is specifically designed to match a set of JSON data and fit it into html snippets using a set of selector based directives.
For this suggestion I am presuming this JSON object is the result of AJAX, and that you already have server-side templates for generating your sites pages. If so, rather then adding yet another template system for client-side, or building the HTML client-side, just have the server generate a HTML response instead JSON. The client then just embeds the HTML in the right place. This keeps the client-side code thinner and simpler, it ensures you still have all your HTML in one place (server-side views), and you can re-use the same templates for generate the web pages. It also allows you to re-design those pages with no, or very few, changes needed in the client-side JS.
please dont recommend things as "best". Your mileage varies with every implementation. I personally prefer KnockoutJS for all of my templating needs because of the 2-way databinding and ease of use.
ah, yea my mistake.. case still stands if you want to use the #list-template.
I down voted you because you are absolutely wrong. A single join operation takes longer to execute than a collection of push methods or concat operations. Therefore jspref, in this case, will always give you the wrong answer. In the real world a series of array pushes with a single join about 1x faster than string concatenation per every 10k of total string length, such that a 200k string is 20x faster to build out with push/join. I can prove this too: 1) Find the largest CSS file you possibly can, minimum of 50k, but the larger the better... 2) Supply the URI of this file or paste its contents into the following tools directly. * String concat: http://prettydiff.com/testlocation/prettydiff1.com.xhtml?mode=beautify * Array: http://prettydiff.com/?mode=beautify 3) Look for total processing time in the "Beautify" report 4) To verify the integrity of the test extract the cleanCSS function from each application and perform a diff.
I dont. I think that the API is wonky, but again, Id rather use it than roll my own. The RightJS guy chooses to roll his own, which looks a lot like a hybrid of jQuery and MooTools 
I'm really curious as to why you mean. I've used underscore templates on a couple projects now (small to medium-large sized web apps), and it is definitely not a "broken" approach. What do you mean by a "programmatic approach"? As to testability, I've likewise found the use of templates to be no barrier at all. Again, without knowing what you mean by "programmatic approach" I may just be making incorrect assumptions, but... the separation of js from HTML templates means that I can very easily test the for the desired behaviour. 
That's what facebook ended up doing. They acknowledged the slightly higher hit of performance instead of pure JS approach yet the development time and conformity offset that. Had used something that can convert my HTML objects to straight HTML or JSON. But ended up scrapping the JSON implementation for easier maintenance.
That's what CSS3 emulation is for. And besides who needs animation in older browsers? Since when were animations anything but annoying niceties.
That's because I have zero tolerance for incompetence and actively engage myself with people doing it right. You should come join this world, it's nice.
You did so well, but then on line 5 you used jQuery :( and then it went down hill.
You seemed to be confused about how this works. You should [never use inline HTML in javascript](http://raynos.org/blog/15/No-inline-HTML-in-javascript!) A nice solution is to just create DOM nodes. var createLinkItem = function () { var link = document.createElement("a"); link.textContent = link; var listItem = document.createElement("li"); listItem.appendChild(link); return listItem; } And of course, since your using the DOM directly it's an order of magnitude faster then hacking HTML or using jQuery.
Wouldn't it be faulty if anything broke code?
Quite redundant yes. Just an assurance that it won't break anything in the process, since it is actually modifying the code.
What, might I ask, is it fixing?
Text templates kinda suck. I've been using jquery templates for a project and you'll often get errors with little to no debugging information from them. I've seen some interesting ways to keep your view code somewhat clean by doing things like using data attributes (like how it's done in [batman.js](http://www.batmanjs.org) ~~or [knockout.js](http://www.knockoutjs.com)~~). These make it pretty easy to write your views/templates in HTML while still have them generated programatically. It's also a lot cleaner than using strings. I'm working on a little web app and have just been constructing my nodes by simply using document.createElement. It's a bit codier, but I like it since I'm not writing my HTML in strings which can be pretty error prone, where I can just get the browser to do this for me. Edit: Knockout actually uses jQuery templates. I must've confused it with something else.
I've got a list compiled here: https://github.com/goatslacker/jshint-autofix In a nutshell: It places or removes semicolons where they're missing/unnecessary, removes any trailing/leading decimals on numbers, adds/removes white space, fixes statements written in square-bracket notation which can be written in dot notation, etc.
You should mention that this is the most "performant" solution when done this way. This is, by no means, the only way to do this however.
It's not necessary of course, but if you are planning on using jQuery throughout your site, returning it as a jQuery object isn't necessarily the "Wrong" approach, but for those JS purists who like to step away from the jQuery library as much as possible until absolutely necessary, yes you are correct. :)
&gt;And for the few cases where you do have user input as HTML you can use a sensible abstraction which creates a document fragment from some HTML (that sensible abstraction will probably use .innerHTML) Do you think you could give an example of this as well?
Jade templates are my favorite! I precompile them into a single JS file though before adding them into a page... makes life much easier. :)
You can try fixing the capitalization of the 4th image from jeep avenger.jpg to Jeep Avenger.jpg. I think the 5th and 6th images are working, they just aren't loading until after the 4th image 404's. I am guessing by fixing the capitalization of the 4th image, these will fix themselves as well. Anyway, that is where I would start. As far as what steps you can take to troubleshoot? I'm no good at that, sorry.
&gt; You seemed to be confused about how this works. That's why he asked the question. &gt; You should never use inline HTML in javascript Your `createLinkItem` function is: * more verbose * less clear * slower* than OP's method. * Most recent benchmark I could find is 3 years old (http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/innerhtml.html)[quirksmode]. Maybe things have changed.
It doesn't influence the code in this case at all. Definitely should be declared in that closure though for sure.
How is navigating to another site, bringing back a link, and forcing readers to follow that link any easier? At least pastebin gets you syntax highlighting, so it's not a total loss.
I'm a fan of [Icanhaz](http://icanhazjs.com/). Prevents having to use multiline strings in js.
For some of the other images that *do* load, you're loading up an image of a larger size than the viewport and then forcing the browser to resize it. If nothing else, that's inefficient, and you should be resizing and compressing them server side before you send it across the wire. This is especially obvious in "http://67.23.251.34/img/DSC00034_066_053.jpg" as it's clearly the file straight from a camera and comes in at whopping 1.6 megs and 1800x1350 when you're only showing it at 600x450. Also, this goes double for your thumbnails. You're losing all the benefit of loading in lightweight thumbnails by forcing the browser to load the whole large image and then just resizing it for the thumbnail. You should be sending over a separate thumbnail sized image, instead of waiting for all the images to fully load (which takes a minute with the large image sizes) before having accessible thumbnails.
No problem! Glad it helped ya :) 
my first thought at looking at the code is that you're using "new array()" when the array constructor is capitalized (eg. should be "new Array()"). even better than that, though, is to use array literals (eg. instead of "new Array(1, 2, 3)", just use "[1, 2, 3]").
This is a really neat technique that can save tons of time! Thanks for sharing! Now to incorporate this with tools like HAML or Jade.... :) 
Lots of broken HTML, unterminated statements. Can you not use something like [Komodo](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit) that'll at least check for syntax errors? Like kbjr said, you should use [] instead of **A**rray. See [here](http://pastebin.com/dG2bTAgR).
Seconded. It's a thin wrapper on mustache js templates giving you a way to code your templates into your page for use later.
Why not just premake the second select tags, make all of them display:none and just show/hide accordingly when an option is chosen in the other select. Full disclosure: I am bad at javascript.
Believe it or not, I'm not allowed too array literals. I tried and took it to his office like that and he said I'll lose points if I do it like that (my guess is because he doesn't know it). I'll try capitalizing the array constructor. EDIT: Capitalizing worked! Thanks! Now all I got to do is figure out why the search by department/semester won't....
* creating a new array is typically done with the language syntax (e.g.: ' var courses = []'), your declaration ' var courses = new array () ' misspells the constructor function because of the lowercased first letter. Same with all the inner arrays. * you are missing '&gt;");' in the inner most loop of viewAll(array). * selectSemester() and selectDepartment() fail to close an open table tag * both the above functions overwrite the value of 'output' instead of adding to (concatenating with) the existing value. This same line also declares the variable 'output' (e.g.: ' var output') but that declaration should be before the first use in the function (e.g.: var output += "&lt;table" ... ) * at the beginning of the functions 'output' has no value, so it should just be ' var value = "&lt;table" ... ' * in functions selectSemester and selectDepartment you use 'courseArray' instead of 'courses' - 'courseArray' is not defined; in some cases you use 'array' which is also not defined. * all your functions should not bother taking an argument since you have the array of courses in global context, and you can get the value of the drop down from the DOM. I'm not saying this is a best practice, but your use of the functions (the onclick attributes) are passing in literal strings instead of the expected array. * you never clear the old data off the page. Instead of 'document.write' which will continually add to the page at the location the dom processor is at (or something close, prolly not exactly accurate), you should create an empty div with an id (like "display" or something meaningful) and replace it's contents (e.g.: document.getElementById("display").innerHTML = output; ) (and I'm not sure how cross-browser that is, so beware) * not all of your for loops declare the loop variable; e.g.: you need " for (var i ..." instead of just "for (i ..." * select html elements had a superfluous select attribute * you should examine the placement of your tags and for loop blocks; my initial results got lots of repeated back buttons. it may help greatly to properly indent your code, and get a decent syntax-highlighting editor. If you are on windows I highly highly recommend Notepad++. I also recommend a decent debugger and some web development tools, like firefox+web develeper + firebug, but I hear great things about Opera and Chrome. IE developer toolbar is a pittiance (i haven't tried past IE8, so maybe it's improved). If you see a lot of javascript warnings it usually means that your javascript or HTML is so malformed that the processor had to abort and did not bother reading the rest of the script or page. Trust me, I've been there. Sometimes you have to scrap what you have and start over with the basics, building up from the smallest piece of functionality that gives you a result. In short, and I don't want to say this to be mean, the code is abysmal. I only say that because if your teacher could not find anything wrong with it then you need to find a better teacher. You have a workable idea, but it feels like you got frustrated and started throwing a bunch of stuff at the JS parser in the hopes that something - anything - would give you a result, so maybe that's the source of a lot of the mistakes I pointed out. Good luck. 
Thank you! I'm going to get to work on this right away. I have Notepad++ but it doesn't show me errors in syntax for javascript. Is this a addon?
This is quite possibly the most commonly asked javascript question in history. What Google searching have you done prior to becoming the millionth person to ask?
I use notepad++ but it doesn't highlight java script syntax errors for some reason.
No, unfortunately for that you need something more like an IDE, but odd syntax coloring is your clue that something has been forgotten. sucks about not being able to use array literals btw.
sorry, i thought this was going to be a helpful place. if it's so commonly ask, why can't you be a helpful, nice person and answer it. you could also do great help with explaining some difficulties others have had with the issue. if you hadn't been such an ass with the way you explained it's a common question, i would have done some googling and probably found the answer, but instead you had to be an ass to someone who obviously doesn't know what he's talking about. the real problem I'm having is that I don't even know what to look for because I'm asking about methods. I'm sorry I came to a place where people know Javascript so I could learn about Javascript.
Have I transported to 1996? This code could be passable for that time period. I bet your professor hasn't had any experience outside of the first few chapters of the first edition of javascript for dummies.
I don't think it's possible in NP++. The only thing it can do is use JSLint, and that's with a bit of fiddling about. Komodo Edit is free, try it. It'll keep you on the right lines at least. Alternatively, use an online validator like [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/).
You could wonder how I feel!
Familiarize yourself with chrome's inspector. F12, ctrl+shift+I, command+alt+I, depending on your system. Hit the tabs for network to see which resources are slow or 404ed. Use the console to check on errors.
I'll give Komodo a shot. And thanks for the validator, that's going to be a great tool for finding future errors.
My advice is get some code written first. Get a clear idea of what needs to happen, and actually write out the code/pseudocode/"magic goes here" to make it happen. If you can get to the point of asking "why doesn't this work" or "how can I improve this design," you will be a lot easier to help. Here's a hint, though: whatever you do will involve using the onchange attribute of the selects.
This is an AWESOME thread. Bookmarking, and thanks you guys. Also, just a reminder that jQuery has a templating engine as well, since I didn't see anyone mention it. Love it: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.tmpl/
"I've been using jquery templates for a project and you'll often get errors with little to no debugging information from them." You do realize Knockout USES jQuery templates, right?
i was using onclick
Excellent post, thank you. Made testing a lot simpler for me. As far as the actual organization of the project files, I'm a bit confused though. Are you saying you have: - 1.) All your actual functions in your app's relevant JS file - 2.) A separate HTML file containing all of the relevant tests and testing libraries, completely separate from your actual app's project files So that the testing HTML/JS is completely compartmentalized and can be removed from the actual project without preventing the app itself from working?
Do you pay us some sort of salary? If I were you, I'd tone down my sense of entitlement a little. People are indeed here to help others, but most of us have jobs and we have to prioritise who we help first - every second spend tediously typing out an answer to your question that you could have found yourself, is a second *not* spent on somebody else - maybe somebody who could not so easily find an existing answer.
 &lt;script&gt; function primarySelectOnChange(el, targSelectId) { //make other select do the thing you want } &lt;/script&gt; ... &lt;select onchange="primarySelectOnChange(this,'secondarySelect')"&gt; ... Have you gotten that far at least? Maybe onclick is workable for that too; I don't actually remember off the top of my head.
&gt;So that the testing HTML/JS is completely compartmentalized and can be removed from the actual project without preventing the app itself from working? Yes, exactly. All test-specific code, libraries, frameworks live in the "test" folder and the tests import the necessary application libraries/code with relative paths. 
You could also use the push method on your array or arrays. That way you won't need to provide an array index for adding another array to courses. courses.push( ["ACC", "202", "Financial Accounting", "B", "Fall 2008"], ["EDU", "201", "Learning Theories", "AB", "Fall 2008"] // ... );
Excellent, thanks again! Out of curiosity, do you know any good books/tutorials on QUnit (or even Jasmine/other JS TDD practices)?
Closures won't help, "var" keyword will.
php more like a hack over C, and jQuery is the same thing over JS. but it's not that what matters. what's really puts them into the same category is that they both basically flat lists of functions that make people write shit. yes, yes. you can write nice code in jQuery, so you can in PHP, but because of their simplicity, both of them attract gazillion of monkeys who write shitty code and make it suck for everyone else
RightJS has a safe-mode build, which doesn't pollute the global space
Full disclosure: But you came up with a solution.
Sorry, I can't think of any advice except google around a bit. I learned the basics of Jasmine (well a predecessorm JSpec) from a e-book called "Advanced Javascript" by TJ Holowaychuck . I can't seem to find it online anymore, I believe the publisher may have gone under. If that's the case if you contact him (He's around on IRC on freenode, the web, etc) he might give you a copy or point you to where you can find one. Though it would be a couple years old at this point I'm sure you could still get some use from it.
Lost me at bindings. What's a binding?
Can't I just make a variable 'private' to the function by declaring it inside the function? E.g. function abc() { var i = 123; } Everything outside the function doesn't know about the variable i. What makes the closure method so useful? I'm not getting it :-/
By "programmatic" approach, I mean something that does not deal with text, but rather a DSL that works with real DOM elements. A naive programmatic approach could be class based, for example, like GWTs original UI approach: class AutoCompletingTextInput extends TextInput # Code that adds auto completion capabilities to a text input class SearchBar extends AutoCompletingTextInput # Code that adds search-specific capabilities to an autocompleting text input And then you might use some DSL to construct compound UIs with these abstract DOM elements. It could also be a DSL that comes close to what templates look like, like GWTs UIBinder, although I'm not a fan of the XML. There are lots of approaches. The point is that I want something that knows it is dealing with DOM elements, not a glorified string.replace(). There is an enormous difference in the potential of those two. What I mean when talking about testability is that using a templating system generally implies that you want to be putting things like loops and conditional logic in them (if error==true, add class "error"). That means you need to break out your webdriver tests to test that logic, which sucks. With a programmatic approach, those loops and conditionals would go in your normal code, and you can test them just like you would test any other code in your application. Also, with a programmatic approach, you will get syntax errors from your UI code, which helps cut down on bugs.
I can understand that RightJS adds variables into the global object, but I think that these variables should not be there ("l" is not declared, other functions simply won't work): "l", "curry", "rcurry", "delay", "periodical" 
I stand corrected. I must have confused it with something else then.
I've use a modified version of this technique in my framework. I rewrote it (but used the same technique) so I could get an understanding of what the code is actually doing. My version is here: https://github.com/Daniel15/JSFramework/blob/master/templating.js :)
Have you seen any good implementations of the sort of approach you're talking about? I've been experimenting with a Django-style templating plugin for my DOMBuilder library in which templates are defined using code rather than text, but it's *ugly*: https://github.com/insin/sacrum/blob/master/admin.js#L306-429
slower my ass. Don't link 3 month old benchmarks. [InnerHTML is slow as hell](http://jsperf.com/dom-vs-html-again-and-again/2) Now that you've been informed. Stop spreading mis information. Also yes it's more verbose. Of course it is, but it's not "less clear". It's only less clear if you don't know anything about the DOM. And that's not my problem. Go learn the host objects like any competent developer.
If your building a rich text control or anything else where the user enters text or some templated text you want to render. Then you may want to allow user input as raw html. An example of handling this (without any XSS protection or sanitazation) would be var Fragment = function (html) { var div = document.createElement("div"); var frag = document.createDocumentFragment(); var child; div.innerHTML = html; while (child = div.firstChild) { frag.appendChild(child); } return frag; }
"JS purists ... absolutely necessary" You realise JS purist don't use jQuery right? There is no "absolutely necessary"
When you say `var i = 0` you are binding `i` to a storage location which can store ints(i.e stores n bytes where n is the storage an int takes), and which currently has a value 0. Binding is generic vocabulary. When you say variable, you are referring to something which varies. For simplification, you can say closures close upon the variables in scope.
You're right about DOM speed, though OP mentions having jQuery loaded so raw DOM calls are extraneous as he's looking for a good way to handle string-building HTML.
Try this: http://prettydiff.com/?pastebin It will beautify your code automatically and submit it to pastebin with a single button click.
A good way to handle string building HTML is to simply not do it. use the DOM or use a full blown templating system. The advantage of a full blown templating system is that they are friendly to web designers who know graphic design &amp; HTML/CSS but don't know the DOM. If you don't need to cater to designers use the DOM.
You really should not dump junk in HTML that is not used without javascript. It breaks progressive enhancement.
You're all over this thread beating the "don't string build" drum -- I get it -- but that's idealistic at best and has nothing to do with designers versus developers.
Yes. The i variable in your example will not exist outside the function abc because of function scope. As long as you only need to refer to it inside the function, that works. But what if you wanted to refer to that variable somewhere else down the line? More to the point, what if we wanted to namespace this variable so we knew that the i we are referring to is the right one, and will be available in scope? You do it with a closure: var myScope = function() { return { i : 123 } }(); var i = 7; console.log(i); console.log(myScope.i); Now the i variable is scoped within the closure, "myScope".
I don't see how that breaks progressive enhancement. If anything it is a better solution in those terms than many of the others listed here. It keeps the HTML in the HTML and out of the javascript.
http://code.google.com/closure/templates/ is also worth a look. A comparison and some notes on closure templates vs some others: http://blog.pandaform.com/techie/browser-side-template-engines-roundup/#performance I haven't found a good performance comparison of closure templates and handlebars or similar yet, if someone else finds one, I'd be interested to see it.
Thanks, this clarifies.
"Beautiful feat" kind of understates a 75x increase in speed.
doesnt jquery create dom elements from strings? if so, do you have a problem with that approach?
A few more things: - Correct HTML requires values to be wrapped in double-quotes, not single, and without a space around the = character. var output = "&lt;input type='button' value='back' onclick='window.location.reload()'&gt;"; should be var output = '&lt;input type="button" value="back" onclick="window.location.reload()"&gt;'; and &lt;select name="department" select id = "department" size="1"&gt; should be &lt;select name="department" id="department" size="1"&gt; - `&lt;table border&gt;` doesn't make sense. You need to actually define something here. Sure it defaults to some value, but you should explicitly define it. - Sometimes in your for-loops you increment with `i++`, sometimes with `++i`. Be consistent or have a reason for the exceptions. - If you find yourself copy/pasting code, stop. Write another function or declare another string. This code can be moved to its own function. Now you can reference these functions/variables rather than copy/pasting the actual strings. function writeCourseRow(course_index) { output += "&lt;tr&gt;"; for (var col = 0; col&lt;courseArray[course_index].length; ++col){ output += "&lt;td&gt;" + courseArray[course_index][col] + "&lt;/td&gt;"; } output += "&lt;/tr&gt;"; } /* global */ var tableHeading = "&lt;table border&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Department&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Number&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Semester&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;"; var resetButton = '&lt;input type="button" value="back" onclick="window.location.reload()"&gt;'; 
Funny, my first thought was "How did they paste `script` into the message board?". Some message boards don't allow you to submit the word `script` in a [code] tag. So the workaround was always document.write(unescape("%3Cscr" + "ipt src=...")); Maybe my memory is fuzzy to the specific instance or situation. I was an oldschool member of webxpertz.net forums.
Done something similar, but populated moustache templates via hashs and lists. So the code paths on the clients into the templates are nearly the same ( python -&gt; moustache , js -&gt; moustache ) same exact template used in both places
sympathies to you, your instructor is an incompetent.
I do have a problem with jQuery creating dom elements from strings yes. However I do not have a problem with creating a dom element from a tagName. You need to specifiy a tagName to create an element.
okay but what is your issue? i don't understand what is wrong with $("#foo").append("&lt;p&gt;bar&lt;/p&gt;"); if jquery parses and executes that as proper dom js. are you saying it doesn't do that? please clarify so i can understand better.
jQuery internally parses it and uses the correct DOM methods. My objection is that _developers_ should not be thinking in terms of HTML. HTML is a text format servers give to a HTML parser build into the browser. Once that HTML has been passed you have a DOM tree. A DOM tree is not HTML. I simply find it bad practice to think in terms of HTML strings in your code. 
I love the Magicka reference.
i understand your position, but i feel you are a bit too hard lined about it because it is a very fine distinction. there are several ways to skin a cat. $("&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;foo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;") is an easily digestible string that yields proper dom nodes. if we are just talking pure javascript, its another debate about the necessity of something like jq.
So you're looking to [hide sibling &lt;div&gt;'s](https://www.google.com/search?gcx=w&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=javascript%2C+hide+siblings) and keep the main &lt;div&gt; visible? I'm a little dependant on jQuery, so I'm not sure how this will work in plain javascript, but: Give all of the div's a similar class name, for this example we'll use "linkDiv". So, your divs now have two classes, "unhidden" and "linkDiv". Now (in my best plain javascript, which is probably wrong), do this: function unhide(divID) { var item = document.getElementById("divID"); var items = document.getElementsByClass("linkDiv") if (items) items.addClass='hidden'; if (item) item.removeClass='hidden'; } I'm pretty sure addClass and removeClass aren't real javascript functions, so you're going to need to figure out their real equivalents (I recommend googling, "how to add a class, javascript" or "how to remove a class, javascript"). Also, a more efficient way may be to add the CSS attribute "display: none" instead of adding and removing whole classes.
Ditch visibility, you only need display:none for this. Display:block is default for div's so you don't need the .unhidden class at all. On click, just add .hidden to all, then remove it from the correct one (better than having an if-statement in a loop)
What this all boils down to is this: var aug = function() { var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments); var org = args.shift(); if (typeof org === "function") org = org.prototype; for (var i = 0, c = args.length; i &lt; c; i++) { var prop = args[i]; for (var name in prop) { org[name] = prop[name]; } } return org; }; ... nothing fancy. Constructive tips: * Use `hasOwnProperty` within a for..in loop. * Use a function declaration instead of `var func = function(){}` -- makes debugging easier.
Since when did parts of the Javascript community start to classify ten lines of code as a library?
&lt;style type="text/css"&gt; .hidden { display: none; } &lt;/style&gt; &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; function toggle() { var t = document.getElementById("transportation"); if (t.className.match(/hidden/) != null){ t.className = t.className.replace(" hidden", ""); } else { t.className += " hidden"; } } &lt;/script&gt; &lt;div id="transportation" class=" hidden"&gt; My text is here... &lt;/div&gt; &lt;input type="button" value="Toggle" onClick="return toggle();" /&gt;
What would you recommend calling it? To me, no matter how many lines, it provides a utility that isn't built in to native javascript and it's a library because of that. I also see it as a library because I can include it as a dependency in ender and node without having to copy and paste the function all over the place. Just my two cents
I'd call this a utility function, no more, no less. To me, a library is either a larger collection of utility functions, such as underscore.js (http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/) or a cohesive tool chain for a specific task, such as jQuery (DOM manipulation).
* Poor choice of name; besides [is_a()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.is-a.php) already existing in PHP as something completely different, functions prefixed with "is", by convention, return a boolean. * Hey, I heard it was a good idea to modify native prototypes! * Breaks easily: function foo(){} var x = new foo(); typeOf(x); &gt; "Object" x.isa(); &gt; "Function" * Is this better than [other implementations](http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2011/08/08/fixing-the-javascript-typeof-operator/)? Starting to think that the path for new JS devs goes something like this: * learn about truthy/falsey and `===`, blog about it * learn about module pattern, blog about it * learn about typeof, blog about it * learn about closures, blog about it * learn about higher-order functions, blog about it * learn about ECMA5, blog about it * learn about micros, blog about it * learn about Node, blog about it * _etc._
dude, relax. We are ranting about the webservices you are working up against. Not you. The only think you did that could be wrong was your formatDate solution that used eval for some weird reason and was generally unreadable (see my above comment for a cleaner, safer one). Also, I wouldn't give it a generic name like formatDate, but something more specific (since it is very very specific) ) But again, nobody is talking about that, or your article, so stop being so defensive and just relax. btw, what gwynjudd is saying is that the date format that a service emits should be the same format that it accepts. (this is what I always do) Again, this is not a criticism of you, since you didn't write the thing. 
This is copied from my post below, but I altered it just for you. I down voted you only because you are absolutely wrong. The benchmarks on the quirksmode page are not outdated, because they are based upon JS execution in your browser. Their only flaw is that the numbers are too small for high confidence results in the face of timing variance, but fortunately you can run each test multiple times only the average of all runs is accepted for comparison. Before the browsers got super fast with JavaScript, about the time that page was put up, the innerHTML method on a single array join was about 4.5 times faster than using DOM methods and this rate was pretty solid cross browser. Using arrays is still perform better cross browser, but now the benefits differ wildly cross browser. I still show that the innerHTML tests on the Quirksmode page are more than twice as fast as the DOM methods in FF7. This following test is a comparison of string concatenation versus array push methods in the beautification of CSS. In this test I can prove that array pushes and return via innerHTML from a single join is about 1x faster per every 10k of string output. 1) Find the largest CSS file you possibly can, minimum of 50k, but the larger the better... 2) Supply the URI of this file or paste its contents into the following tools directly. * String concat: http://prettydiff.com/testlocation/prettydiff1.com.xhtml?mode=beautify * Array: http://prettydiff.com/?mode=beautify 3) Look for total processing time in the "Beautify" report 4) To verify the integrity of the test extract the cleanCSS function from each application and perform a diff. You can modify this test to fit the criteria of a DOM method versus innerHTML/array push test, but it will require some effort on your part. 1) Go get the original diff output code, which uses only DOM methods, from here: https://github.com/cemerick/jsdifflib/blob/master/diffview.js 2) You will notice that the Pretty Diff code at http://prettydiff.com/prettydiff.js has evolved this code to use only an array and innerHTML and there is a clock timer integrated as well. 3) This is the hard part. You have to clone the Pretty Diff application and in this clone you will have to integrate the contents of the diffview.js file over the contents of the internal diffview function. This will be hard because I have far extended the performance and functionality of this code, so there is a huge amount of effort to be done for a 1 to 1 comparison. Even if this scenario is not 100% accurate there will still be a noticeable difference in performance. I reduced processing time by more than 6x when I originally refactored this code about 2 years ago. There are a couple of reasons why working purely in the DOM is slow, and it has nothing to do with the bloated method names. Most importantly there is only one document object, so events must either collide or wait in line to access it. Also, a large array occupies a single space of memory, where each object in the DOM is a separate memory addressable instantiation. If there were more than one document object on a single web page then I have no doubt that using only DOM methods would be very fast, but this is now how documents on the web work. The only time when using pure DOM methods is faster than building with an array is when relational access to data is necessary while the data is still building. In this case it is preferable to use a DOM fragment and then integrate the fragment when the building is complete, but this is really a rare corner case.
Break the jQuery habit! (sorry Mr. Resig) It's always useful to know how to do things from the ground up, even if you don't need to all the time. A plain JS function similar to what you have: function unhideOnly( divID ) { var div = document.getElementById( divID ); var otherDivs = document.getElementsByClassName( 'link_div' ); for( var i = 0; i &lt; otherDivs.length; i++ ) otherDivs[i].style.display = 'none'; if( div ) div.style.display = 'block'; } You can also create your own addClass() and removeClass() - I prefer using arrays internally: Element.prototype.addClass = function( className ) { var classes = this.getAttribute('class').split(' '); if( classes.contains( className ) == false ) { classes.push( className ); this.setAttribute( 'class', classes.join(' '); return true; } return false; }
There is also another solution built on top of Angus' http://www.2ality.com/2011/11/improving-typeof.html
I see where you’re both coming from. As a user, I do expect a library to have more than one book to choose from :-) That being said, another litmus test is how it’s packaged. The moment that your install goes from “grab the source” to `npm install aug`, I think you can start calling it a library even if it only has one function. Obviously “library” and “package” are not synonyms, but it’s close enough for government work. Disclosure: I have the following two “libraries” bereft of any packaging support: https://github.com/raganwald/YouAreDaChef https://github.com/raganwald/Underscore-Matchers-for-Jasmine
Oh but wait, that li needs a class $("&lt;li class='foo'&gt;&lt;a&gt; foo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;"); Oh but wait, that a needs a href $("&lt;li class='foo'&gt;&lt;a href='link'&gt; foo &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;"); Oh but wait, that link text needs a strong text $("&lt;li class='foo'&gt;&lt;a href='link'&gt; &lt;strong&gt; foo &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;"); It's a slippery slope. Your going to end up with HTML tag soup. Where do you draw the line about "what is too much HTML tag soup in your javascript?" I simply draw my line at any.
Agreed, I'd rather see some interesting content rather than some basic aspect of the language that's been indexed thousands of time by Google. -_-;;
Yes, everyone new to JS seems to think they can solve the problem, and they all feel compelled to blog about it.
A library needs more than one book, otherwise it's just a book.
You should check out WIODE(http://www.wiode.com)
youre making this a pissing contest, because that one line html string will result in 4 proper dom nodes with respective attributes. if you want to break it a zillion ways, you still can... $myLink = $("&lt;a /&gt;"); $myLink.attr("href", "http://google.com"); $myList = $("&lt;li /&gt;").class("foo"); $myItem = $myList.append($mylink); // etc... its still easier for me to read it all in one line, but the potential exists to cut it however you want. you are acting like an html string isn't a valid way of constructing nodes, when it clearly is (granted, you have to use a library like jq). 
Ugh, agreed, that was horrid.. The "best" implementation (not approach, big difference in words :) ) I've seen is GWTs UI classes, that works kind of like I described in the class based approach above. It's broken in a couple of ways, partly in that it becomes extremely verbose, and takes a lot of code to work with. A big chunk of pain also comes, in my humble opinion, from the fact Object Oriented programming itself is an anti-pattern, and the cracks are particularly evident when using it for this kind of stuff. A Composite Oriented approach would ease a lot of pain here. That's another battle though :) I think the main reason GWT decided to augment their initial approach with their UIBinder tool was partly due to this, and partly due to the fact that designers really like to work with "real" HTML. UIBinder combines the class based approach with an XML flavor that lets you combine raw HTML and more complex abstract UI elements. This discussion led me to toy with a CoffeeScript-based DSL on a flight I just got off, it looks something like this: class ApplicationView mixin this, DOMFragment # Code for this view dom = html( head( title("My page") ) body( new ApplicationView() ) ) I'm not sure if this is a valid approach, we'll see if I hit some dead ends with it..
There are also named function expressions: `var func = function func () {...};` There are some odd quirks in old-IE though. More: http://kangax.github.com/nfe/
This is a much less hacky alternative that gets you the same and a little more: [https://github.com/searls/jasmine-fixture](https://github.com/searls/jasmine-fixture)
Hmm. Didn't even think of that. Thanks! I'll look into this.
I'm amazed how many ways there are to do things. Thanks everyone ill let you know if I get it.
What's actually wrong about reblogging things people already know about? Just because information isn't original doesn't mean it's not worth saying. Of course blogging about some mediocre "Library" that "fixes" typeof is silly
Try thinking in objects; if a cloud is a conceptual thing, then maybe you code around that. Make Cloud an object, and attach methods to it to control the various actions. Something like this: // The "constructor" function Cloud() { // Set up instance attributes this.image = images[ random( images.length )]; this.opacity = random( 0, 100 ); this.speed = random( 1, 10 ); // ... } // An example Cloud method Cloud.prototype.move = function() { // Move the image on the page } // ------------------------------- var cloud = new Cloud(); setInterval( function() { cloud.move(); }, 1000 ); *Note the function random() doesn't exist, so you'd need to write it.* **Edit** Here's the random() I use: function random( min, max ) { if( typeof max !== 'number' ) { min = 0; max = min; } return Math.floor( Math.random() * ( max + 1 - min ) + min ); }
This is a good initiative which has been a long time coming.
You make a good point, and I should actually correct myself to say that I don't care what someone blogs about, I actually love blogs. I just get frustrated because it doesn't present much for content here on reddit. This problem has obviously been dealt with many times before, but the author makes no note of them?
How hard will it be to seperate out jQuery into different modules and let the user piece meal what he wants? Yes, that kills the whole 'jQuery is probably cached in the browser' advantage but atleast takes care of the filesize. And also its more modular. My guess? - Its hard.
is 31kb really too big that it should ruin the cached in browser advantage? Or is it small enough that it doesn't matter.
This is essentially what jQuery uses to determine the type of objects: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L491 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L877
Thanks for the info. I will play around with this tomorrow when I get near my computer again.

Mootools has done this all along and it's one of the greatest strengths of the framework. This has given them the freedom to put together a comprehensive framework in which developers can take the bits they need, and leave the rest. Check out the Core and More builders: http://mootools.net/core/
Maybe they can finally deprecate the animation API, a greatly underused feature that I always thought belonged in a plugin. Don't get me wrong, it has its uses, and slideUp/Down + fadeIn/fadeOut are nice, but I seriously doubt these features are commonly used on many sites. Now that CSS3 is more widely available, it makes sense to sequester this functionality into a plugin for those who want to use animations everywhere (via Javascript) versus others who will opt for CSS3 animations/transitions, which are significantly smoother. I don't know how much these functions contribute to the code size, but I have to expect it's... not insignificant.
Why not use requestAnimationFrame if available? 
If you're going to do that, then there is no reason you can't just cut stuff out yourself. 
That's always been a bit misleading - it's 31kb down the wire (Gzipped). It gets expanded, parsed, and executed. Anything to remove cruft is welcome and reduces execution time, which is especially noticeable on mobile devices. That's especially welcome because jQuery Mobile pulls in desktop jQuery as a dependency. If I'm developing primarily for iOS and Android, I shouldn't have to worry about all the little desktop browser workarounds. Ideally I shouldn't see stuff like attachEvent at all, but it's there...
as I said before, there is a safe-mode build of RightJS which doesn't pollute the global space, neither it adds anything to the JavaScript natives. The only thing it creates is the `RightJS` variable. Unlike other frameworks RightJS gives you a choice, either use a Prototype style build with all the extensions and handy functions, or use the jQuery style safe-mode build, which has a zero foot-print on the system. http://rightjs.org/tutorials/safe-mode
This won't ever happen, I think. It puts another step (configuration) between discovery and actual use for new users, which is a process they're trying to keep as efficient as possible.
Check out append.to
Personally, I think *a lot* of people use slideUp/Down or fadeIn/fadeOut at some point in their code.
A lot of sites are using it. There are a lot of shit i could see going before the animations api. However as with everything there is a need for a fair and balanced study on the usage metric on the methods in the API to decide which shall be deprecated.
I feel like there's enough sites out there that use jquery, and they could probably just compute a histogram of all the methods in use. Then just cut the bottom 25% of the lesser used api functions.
I didn't know this; it sounds like jQuery Mobile needs to be rewritten as a fork of regular jQuery.
Also those are probably written as shortcuts to the complete animation API which I would be loath to lose.
If you're anything like me, all boxes are checked at all times
Mootools is still my favorite JS library. Although since I don't get to pick usually, I spend most of my time in jQuery (which I also enjoy). I just love the more object-oriented structure of Mootools code vs jQuery, which generally turns out to be just lots of big functions (and no I don't want to start a debate over functional vs OOP, this is just my preference).
[Zepto](http://zeptojs.com/)
Not if it isn't built modularly in the first place.
I'm not disagreeing at all; remember, I didn't say yank it out and toss it, I said pull it into a plugin. They get used with enough frequency that the option to retain them should be kept, but if we're looking to the future to build a slimmer jQuery, we should recall that a lot of that API is better expressed through CSS (except in cases of backwards compatibility) - and should therefore not be in the *core* library.
I know they _are_ being used, but I'm saying their function is better represented through CSS. If we're looking to the future, pull out animations into a plugin and recommend people use CSS transitions in place of the Javascript animations.
This is probably the fairest suggestion I've seen. I just hope it doesn't lead to stuff like `.offset()` getting cropped :-/
DOWN WITH JQUERY. DOWN WITH PHP. DOWN WITH EVERYTHING THAT MAKES PEOPLE'S LIVES EASIER. A STEADY HAND AND A MAGNETIZED NEEDLE IS THE WAY TO GO!
Get rid of selectors. Who uses that shit?
Ok, so I guess that not declaring "l" variable is fine... BTW, how do I use window.curry with "unsafe mode" (for example) ?
I can definitely take a look into it. I would have to do some testing to see how and where it could make things more efficient
It says my graphics card doesn't support WebGL while I've run plenty of other WebGL projects on this computer. I'm on a 27" iMac 2011.
This is amazing. I'm on Ubuntu 10 / Chrome / NVidea card.
Interesting. I didnt know that jQuery team wanted to eliminate the process of configuration so that there's a low barrier of entrance. I always jQuery just became to be one monolithic library. So its by design, is it? Makes sense.
If you are using Math on every call, you could store the Math or Math methods in a variable to reduce overhead. Just my 2 cents.
Regardless of the relative merits and/or usefulness of such a project, I'll give them credit for having an incredibly detailed and informative project page. As for the project itself, after a brief look this part seems paradoxical to me: &gt; The jClassy library will presumably suite [sic] your needs proportionally to the following conditions: &gt; You dislike the `new` operator. While I recognize that OO-paradigms can be produced that do not use the `new` keyword, it seems counter-intuitive that a system to introduce classes would not make use of it; perhaps it's simply a limitation of the implementation, but it seems odd.
This is true, the coupling is too tight. For example, in [ajax.js](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js), the following external properties are referenced: * jQuery.fn.load * jQuery.isFunction * jQuery.param * jQuery.makeArray * jQuery.isArray * jQuery.map * jQuery.each * jQuery.extend * jQuery.parseJSON * jQuery.event * jQuery.Deferred * jQuery.Callbacks * jQuery.trim * jQuery.now * jQuery.isPlainObject The list probably isn't 100% accurate, and many of these properties may be found in [core.js] (or some other util-like file), but I think you can see how it isn't as modular as it appears.
So, refactor for those most-common use-cases; there is a _lot_ of code required to support animations, I also think that it would be better-served as a plugin. Provide basic support in core, maybe, but not the entire kitchen sink of "effects". Animations are not part &amp; parcel to web sites.
NNNNVIIIIIIDDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEa
They've [done similar work](http://ejohn.org/blog/selectors-that-people-actually-use/) in the past, but that was for selectors. I believe they've done the same for jQuery on-the-whole, but I'm not positive.
*It turns out* that objects are just special cases of closures, so really functional style languages..... I keed.
Most of the early libraries that jQuery built off-of, like Prototype, MooTools, etc. all had a "pick what you want" to download setup, and it caused lots of problems. Users would go to the page, get confused about what they wanted, and either give up or download the wrong items. Remember, this is when JS libs were still fairly new, especially DOM/AJAX libs, and so devs weren't accustomed to all of the complexity involved in simply downloading the lib. Stable or development version? Is the core module required? What about utils? Those types of problems do indeed create a barrier to entry, and so by jQuery offering 1 download (2 if you count minified vs. normal) it greatly simplified the process.
RightJS provides the Function#curry method. `window.curry` is probably just some accidentally created variable. In any case RightJS doesn't depend on the global vars, they are just links to its internals. So the user can safely remove/replace any of those as they see fit. There is for example a jquery emulation plugin, which replaces the '$' function to make it act as the one in jq.
what do you mean? RightJS also makes people's life easier :) and unlike jQ, rightjs is not just for housewives and web-designers, it also makes life easier for hardcore folks as well
I like Crockford's the good parts paired with [Professional Javascript for Web Developers](http://www.amazon.com/Professional-JavaScript-Developers-Wrox-Programmer/dp/047022780X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1320868295&amp;sr=8-1) by Nicholas C. Zakas. [JavaScript Garden](http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/) is also really nice.
Not worth the distraction for a new programmer.
Fair enough.
are you using up to date versions chrome, firefox, or opera?
very pretty, nice job! Should put this in the official samples! 
This is amazing on my built in graphics on my Intel i5 laptop
LOL - My post was in response to the iMac guy but I didn't reply properly I guess. Still amazing and cool.
"Holy shit!" was my first reaction.
I didn't get any real feedback, figured I'd try the JS sub.
If you thought that was impressive: http://lights.elliegoulding.com
Problem 1: change the selector at line 109: $("nav a[href="+newHash+"]").addClass("current"); to: $("nav a[href$=\""+newHash+"\"]").addClass("current");
What is the difference in environments between your local and the server? The only thing weird that I could spot was that your NGINX server is not sending content-type headers in request responses.
My point is: there are other "accidentally created variables". 
k, done. what'd I just do?
I would like JQuery to slim down to the point of actually being a query language as the name suggests - instead of using Ajax. It's not AjaxQuery, it's JQuery - but there is one problem, JQuery can't actually query anything. There is no Query language built into JQuery - except for Ajax. So, let's talk about Ajax, and stop talking about JQuery.
Actually I thought it was an issue with the href value (including the base URI of the page). I was wrong, it's just a syntax issue with jQuery selector (despite it is valid in CSS): you must add quotes for href value. So, this selector will also work: $("nav a[href=\""+newHash+"\"]").addClass("current"); edit: this fixes a JavaScript error (at least with chrome) but I realize that it does not change anything for arrows issue...
well see, the confusing thing is I'm using Coda and in the Coda preview (aka Chome inside Coda) it doesn't work. Then when you pop out the preview to the actual Chrome application, it works. And then when you actually upload to the server, it goes back to not working, just like Chrome inside of Coda.
A slimmer JQuery - Ajax.
Mocha takes mootools into the future: http://designingwebinterfaces.com/tag/mochaui http://mochaui.org/dev/Demo/ https://github.com/moofoo/mochaui/commits/my_mochaui Mocha web desktop based on mootools = the future. 
can you not use jquery? because if you can use jquery I recommend that. It would look something like this: $(document).ready(function(){ $("#the ID of the button or link you want to have clicked to hide your div").click(function(){ $("#divID").slideToggle(); }) })
If you inspect the IMG elements of "previous" and "next" buttons with chrome developer tools, you'll see that there are no handlers for click events but I really don't know why...
That's just stunning
Yup, I double checked, latest version of Chrome. It worked on my laptop though.
well the click events are in the JQuery.....somewhere. $(".nextbutton").click(function(event){
Coda uses Safari as the in-browser preview
for firefox - the width is too tight on the nav element causing the links to wrap. you can change your width on nav to 980px and that will fix it. nav {width: 980px;} then you will have to play with your hover state so it doesnt overlap into your photo. one thing you may want to look into to make your life easier cross-browser is using css resets: EDIT: also for problem #1, its not a code issue. I looked at it locally and everything worked (sliding nav, opacity on arrow buttons). I didnt see anything that would be causing the issue so I put your code up on my domain and it works there as well. 
I am without words. That was stunning.
That was so good I forgot what the original submission was for a moment.
Scratch an itch. Think of a annoying problem that you have and try to fix it with javascript. 
oCanvas seems quite awesome
This is what I imagine would be a commercial for acid would look like were it legal.
What if I don't have any annoying problems? 
[Userscripts](http://wiki.greasespot.net/User_script) are a good way to mess around with something w/ out starting from scratch. Start with calculators or some sort of tool - that should be good practice as well.
It sounds like you have your plan set out in front of you...learn jQuery, backbone.js, underscore.js, jasmine and CoffeeScript, etc. If you want more hands on work and you lack an imagination or necessity, then look at some of the projects done with the libraries above and try to replicate/improve. For example, try building a image carrousel in jQuery, or an interactive whiteboard using node and canvas. 
Yeah I thought about doing that or making a Chrome extension. Just intimidating, I suppose.
http://projecteuler.net/ Or if you want something involving the DOM, look at say Reddit. Then make a quick little demo that will pop-open a textarea when you click something. Then add a "save" button and have it save the comment via AJAX.
you should break it down to something that works on both of your dev servers, then re-enable a little at a time. I noticed a few things that seem kinda meh: double-check your if/else conditions . declare your variables separately; each with a semi-colon and a separate line. cleanly formatting your code could expose a stray curly brace.
Make an image slider ( sure it would be recreating the wheel ) but if you make one that can nicely animate through a variable number of images, with buttons allowing the user to move the slider left and right - and which could also respond to the users keyboard input - you'll have learned a number of good basic lessons along the way. Or write a form that has validation for email addresses, passwords that must match, etc with nice error messages to prompt the user when they get part of the form right or wrong. Good lessons in that too.
Oo. The latter sounds like something that would be fun to do. Thanks!
Things like email validation can be nice client-side, but they're useless without the server also checking validation. I know that this wouldn't have any server, but it's good advice to keep in mind.
Best of luck! : ) One more for fun Make a box that responds to keyboard input - when you press the left arrow, it should move a few pixels to the left, and so on.
So how could I do both? I wouldn't mind messing around server side as well. I've played a _teeeeeny_ bit with node.js if that helps.
I'm in the same boat. I looked up some exercises online and took them on/am taking them on/am totally ADD and moving on to other things. I did write some basic form validation code, though. 
Of course. Javascript is no protection. The purpose of this is to prompt the user when e.g. their password is not matching / not strong enough, so they can correct it prior to sending the request to the server. Less waiting and so on.
Yeah I'm terribly ADD. It's awful. I started learning jQuery but for some reason just can't get into it. I want to do something, just not sure what. I'm googling around for form validation right now though :)
You can try fiddling with a idea that'd be challenging, and wonder what else you can do to make it better when you're done with it. You'll encounter mistakes and problems along the way, but (hopefully) you'll learn ways to avoid those mistakes and solve those problems as well. Thus, getting a better understanding of the language and how to solve the problems you encountered. 
Use an object (also known as a "hash"). They are sets of keys and values. You could define an object like so: var array = {}; var anotherArray = {key:"value", anotherKey:0, anObject:{thisis:"inception"}}; Then set things to it like so: array["key"] = true; array.foo = false; You can use the "dot way" (.foo in the example) for simple keys (ones that contain 0-9, a-z, A-Z and _ and do not begin with a number). You cannot get a value from the array with a variable through this method. Another way is the "bracket way" (["key"] in the example). You can put a string -- or anything representing a string, such as a variable. Take a look at this example: var key = "reddit"; var array = {reddit:" is awesome."}; alert(key + array[key]); That code displays an alert containing "reddit is awesome." Keep in mind that using complex strings as key names is frowned upon. You wouldn't do this: var array = {foo:"bar"}; array["this isn't something you should do"] = "but it is still valid"; Basically, whenever you would have a variable whose name is represented by another variable, use objects. Technically, you could do the following with "eval": var thisIsAVariable = "foo"; var variableName = "thisIsAVariable"; eval("alert(" + variableName + ")"); However, this is considered one of the worst things you could do to solve your problem. "eval" is ugly and can cause security issues. Have fun coding and enjoy! **TL;DR: objects.** &lt;le_edit&gt;I used "array" where I should've used "object" (or at least, I think that's what YmMotHimself meant). Arrays aren't exactly objects, but this code still sorta works: var array = [1, 2, 3]; // that's how you define an array array.key = "roflcopters"; // using an array as if it's an object, which it technically is alert(array.key); // -&gt; roflcopters It's because arrays are a type of object, so you can use them as objects. It's sorta dumb, though.&lt;/le_edit&gt;
Don't worry about server-side for now. Right now it seems you'd just be messing around with HTML files on your hard drive. Just try to do a JS-based form validator. What I said was just advice for when you do begin making server-side applications.
If foo and bar were declared on the global scope, window['foo'] If they are properties on an object and you have access to that object, obj['foo'] If you are in the scope of the object that has those properties, this['foo'] 
There's a bug in their detection code. It does the same for me in linux with the latest chromium dev build. I can run other webgl apps fine in the same browser. It only works on my windows machine.

Here's a challenge for you... find javascripts and duplicate them without using the original source.
Do things you'd end up doing in a front end role. Someone mentioned a slider, that's not a bad idea. Try mimicking some sites and/or their effects e.g. for their menu, gallery, showcase, whatever it is. On the job you're constantly going to be doing things you've never done before. Come up with imaginary clients and how javascript would even be part of a solution at all. it may not be. but if it is what's the shortest path to completion that looks &amp; feels robust yet doesn't leave anyone hanging? without experience you're not really going to be able to make sense of that but start coming up with designs or site features however common they might be and start problem solving.
Try and port a library or application done in another programming language to javascript. It's how I'm currently learning. :]
0. If you don't already have firebug installed, do so. (Its a FireFox extension) Experiment with the debugger. Find a website that you think is doing something neat with JavaScript, use the debugger to walk through their code (assuming its not minified/obfuscated/compiled). 1. Read this: http://www.w2lessons.com/2011/04/you-dont-know-javascript.html The article will put things in to perspective on what are beginner/intermediate/advanced JS topics. If there are holes in your self-described basic knowledge vs what is described as beginner, aim for having a good grasp on those topics. 2. What book did you read/skim? If it wasn't Douglas Crockford's "JavaScript: The Good Parts," I'd strongly recommend reading that cover to cover. Its terse, but has a number of important things you should know as a JS programmer. (Other books to consider later are 'javaScript patterns', 'High Performance JavaScript', and 'Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja') 3. I second finding some sort of project to throw your new found knowledge at; be it some open source project, a new personal side project, or take another pass at one of your existing/old personal projects. Your new found JS skills aren't much good if you can't do anything with them... 4. Don't bother with CoffeeScript, anything that hides the language you are working in from you can only lead to more chaos. It can be bad enough learning the details of JS that you don't need to add another layer of complexity. 5. Learning JQuery is a good idea, but take the time to question how JQuery is doing what its doing. 
- I've got firebug! - I read JS: The Definitive Guide and skimmed The Good Parts. I also read Eloquent JS. I'd really love to get into an open source project, just not sure which one/how I could help/what I could do. This is all great, thanks so much!
Already read this. Didn't really help me much.
Learn Ruby on Rails or Node.js if you want to stay in the javascript world. (&amp; follow up with C, Lisp, Assembly Language, Python and Haskell for good measure.)
Chromes extension API is actually very nice; it's well documented and relatively straightforward. You sacrifice some of the power you would get in say, a Firefox extension...but for a nice beginner JS project it's a good choice. It's designed around web technology, so even though it gets you a bit away from typical front-end stuff what you know now will be useful and what you learn you can carry over.
Start hanging out on IRC. On IRC you will find some of the best JS programmers exchanging knowledge and discussing problems, solutions, projects, etc. You will also find newbies coming in and asking basic questions. By just sitting there and absorbing it all, you will get the answers to questions you didn't even know to ask, or the solution to problems you might face in the future. Once you've lurked a while, start participating.
This is a good answer, but "array" is a very poor choice for a name for the object considering it's not an array; it's liable to confuse newbies. Even if it was an array, it would still be too generic a name; even for an example.
I know a bit of Python which I actually quite love. Also have done a bit of reading about node.js but I don't think I'm there yet cuz it's confusing a bit for me :/
I've actually been considering doing a Chrome extension, even just something simple — especially since uh.. I don't use firefox so I don't think I'd want to build something for it.
Good answer, but just to clarify to OP: in your usecase it would be more like: var lookup = { foo: true } // some code var x = getValueFromXML(); // x is now = "foo" console.log( x ); // prints "foo" doSomethingWith( lookup[ x ] ); // is the same as doSomethingWith( true ) 
whoadude. for(){} is for a reason... 
would console.log() help?
Go for it. If you ever have any questions feel free to PM me, I've made a few.
Seconded. A lot of people will recommend *Javascript: the good parts* which is to be sure a very good book, but not a good choice for a *first* book for someone who is looking for a practical introduction to the language (it doesn't touch on the DOM, etc at all). Read something like *Professional JavaScript for Web Developers* first to get your feet wet, **then** read *The Good Parts*.
You can have a look around http://jsdo.it and fork something that you find interesting... Try to change or add to it and keep a log of what you learnt. Look for coding patterns and see if you can use them in other contexts. Have fun! 
Flask/good js skills can go a long way! Keep it simple and learn the basics.. Or have a look at sinatra for a super easy back end if you go the ruby route. It's good to have a simple server you can pass Ajax calls to to do more database/API manipulation. But first things first, stuck to JS for now!
Get some experience with Javascript outside of the browser. Write a node.js/mongodb application or something.
Profit!
You really should put together a project of some sort. Whether it solves a pain for yourself or for someone else, this is the one thing that is most likely to get you to the next stage in development. It'd be worth looking at tweaking an Open Source project on Github. If that doesnt take your fancy, i have a few project ideas i wanted to do in my spare time on Node.js - They're eventually going to be open source anyhow so if you want any of those ideas, let me know. I've created screenshots for the first app i want to create. its only 2 screens and is conceptually quite simple but will really need some like Node.js for it to work best.
You *could* make an extension for Chrome but you'd only really be learning how to interact with that one specific API. Same could be said for any of the major browsers. Much better to write a small userscript and get it to run across FF/Chrome/Opera/Safari etc. See why it works in one but not the other. That'll improve your JS much more than packaging some extension. &gt;I don't use firefox Nor do I, but if you're proficient in HTML/CSS and looking to push ahead with JS then you should have as many browsers at hand as possible. Good luck!
I wrote that poorly: "Learn a server-side framework: for example Ruby on Rails ---- or Node.js if you want to stay in the javascript world."
What framework are you using? (I used to use it quite a bit, but switching now to Ruby)
Do web projects. Real ones. Preferably with other experienced people that you can learn from. I think the best way of learning Javascript is by applying your knowledge in a real-life situation. I learn new things every time I do a (part of a) project.
same here!
you can simply "eval" it: eval(extractedString); Just make sure you're doing it in the appropriate scope. As a note "eval" is relatively slow so if you plan on doing this often, you may want to consider other solutions. Also if this xml is not generated by you, don't do eval since eval will run ANY code that you put into it and you don't want that. [http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_eval.asp](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_eval.asp)
i don't think you really have a point :) so lets wrap it up
I would suggest making an Opera extension too, if you want. PM me if you need more info or goto dev.opera.com
I would also suggest try using stuff like localStorage/geolocation/web workers/canvas inside your web apps. They require JS to implement, and you'll end up building some cool stuff in the process too. I would especially recommend making something using &lt;canvas&gt; as it will require some interesting JS stuff which I think you'll enjoy. 
This is great, now only if the other browsers would follow suit...
I whole heatedly agreed with all your points except for point 5. CS is a beautiful language that resolves a lot of the JS issues that Crockford specifically mentions in his book (such as JS scoping woes). Many of the patterns in CS come from tried and true methods from using JS for years. Lastly, CS doesn't hide anything. Everything is compiled directly to JS and the JS is fairly straight forward to debug. Anyways, the face of JS is changing (how many projects can you count on your hand that are currently not leveraging JQuery and Underscore?).. and I believe it's important to stay on top of the curve instead of clinging to the old. Oh.. and you can forget firebug if you are on Chromium.. Lastly, I think JQuery is essential to know COMPLETELY in any modern day project. IMHO, JS without JQuery/Underscore is not really JS.. they are so essential that I would never consider not including them. 
Get a job. There are plenty of people who make a good living with proficient HTML/CSS and basic Javascript skills. The only way you learn is by doing, and by working on a team with other developers you'll learn a lot more than following online tutorials.
No, I really wouldn't suggest you lie your way into a job. It will become apparent very quickly if you don't have the skills you say you have. By all means focus on the skills and experience you have and paint yourself in a positive light, but draw the line at outright deception as it won't do you any favours.
JS without jQuery / underscore is not really JS? Bullshit. underscore doesn't give you anything substantial that ES5 doesn't already have. jQuery is simply a (rather mediocre) cross browser normalization tool
Yes coffeescript is javascript, but learning coffeescript now isn't going to help you learn more javascript. One should consider to use coffeescript merely as a personal style choice once one has a good grip on javascript.
Surely there are websites you visit that you could be improved a little (eg by hiding or collapsing ads or parts of the interface)? Write a greasemonkey script.
I wrote this as an updated test page of my XAudioJS library, which lets js developers generate and output audio in real time in a cross browser manner. The library supports Moz Audio Data API, Web Audio API, and even a flash fallback for the ye olde browsers. **Please allow approximately 45 seconds for this page to load, as it has to download a large base64 of an uncompressed WAV file.** For slowdowns in chrome: Shrink your window, chrome is too slow with scaling! (Funny, because it runs fullspeed in Firefox 3.6 on my mac)
You mean something like this? for (var i = 0; i &lt; 2darr.length; i++) for (var j = 0; j &lt; 2darr[i].length; j++) createTile(i, j, 2darr[i][j]); } } 
Scientific papers and blogs, mostly. ;-)
Where's the force feedback api?
You really need to have personal projects drive your programming. You're pretty useless as a programmer without experience in what you're learning.
About damn time...
There isn't a whole lot of advice we can give if you can't find any code to write. Write a greasemonkey script to make a web page look or behave as you wish it would. Find an open source project you use or are interested in and fix a bug, add a feature. Or just start writing something yourself, try to write something that you think would be cool or should exist. But others have already mentioned these things, so... go write something. Anything! It doesn't matter if it's been done before. Write something that you know has been done and then compare your code to some existing code. That's a great way to learn.
[Here you go](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/113780/javascript-curry-what-are-the-practical-applications)
I thought the point was that he doesn't have the skills and should learn on the job?
vlatheimpaler is totally right! for me there are not many things that are more satisfying than whipping up a simple graphical demo or visualize an algorithm. i remember discovering "mode 13h" when learning pascal at school. oh the joy when canvas made easy doodling possible again without having to write a ton of boilerplate just to draw a dot. i'd say just start doodling around with canvas demos until you feel that displaying forms would be more interesting (heh). what i did: * visualizing an evolutionary algorithm (the algorithm itself is bullshit but it's fun to watch it work) * create a height map with simplex noise and then watch A* finding a path from A to B stuff like this! bouncy balls (simple physics), maybe even some game mechanics and so on.
Anyway, I'll never use RightJS since its author does not seem to know what he is doing ;)
You can get integers from the style values without using a regexp, using [parseInt](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_parseInt.asp): // Ensure decimal integer, set 40 as default value var x = parseInt( style.left, 10 ) || 40; var y = parseInt( style.top, 10 ) || 40; Also, you can pass setTimeout / setInterval a function, instead of text to be executed: setTimeout( function() { moveText( x, y ); }, 1000 ); The second argument to setTimeout, 1 in your code, is the number of milliseconds for the timeout. That's pretty fast, and means that changing color every 5 steps would result in a different color every 5ms, which would likely be impossible to see. I'd use 1000, equal to 1 second, for the timeout. Now, for the color changing, you could have a variable that tracks the number of runs, but as others will tell you, it's best to not have a ton of global variables lying around, so you might want to look at putting all this into an object to control the code. In the meantime: var moveCalls = 0; function moveText() { // Your code... if( ++moveCalls == 5 ) { dom.style.color = newColor; moveCalls = 0; } } **Update**: By the way, if you need the scrolling to be that fast (1ms), just break the color code into its own function, and have its timeout be longer than the moveText() one.
Then think of something cool or useful. Example: What if you wanted to do a word count on a paragraph block? Now try to write a function for that.
I hope you never use color changing or scrolling text in an actual project. If you use scrolling &amp; color changing text together, people will work very hard to punch you through the Internet. Also, if you're allowed, look into using a JS framework like jQuery to save you having to reinvent the wheel.
&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;
I think ready() works a lot better than load() with regard to cross-browser compatibility.
Take over the world!
They are not the same thing, for example you cannot declare another variable with a same name inside a function scope (shadowing). From Coffeescript's documentation: "So be careful that you're not reusing the name of an external variable accidentally" You need to maintain both languages in your head because of debugging. I don't see the advantages Coffeescript brings to be so great that you would want to replace Javascript in every situtation because there are compromises (e.g. compiling).
1. There is a [r/Unity](http://www.reddit.com/r/unity), though it looks desolate; as long as your question involves javascript (which I must point out is _completely different_ than Java), then it's fine here. 2. It might help to give us a sample of your data structure that you intend to work with; the logic required to process the data is wholly dependent upon the structure of said data. It sounds like you want something like this: var points = [ [1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6], [7, 8, 9] ]; Is that correct? If not, then please let us know. 
Nice, definitely will use this.
Partial applications of functions are ridiculously useful. Currying makes that indistinguishable from "normal" application.
Currying is not just for Javascript. In general you can think of currying as a specific type of function wrapping, typically the outer wrapper function has fewer arguments than the general purpose function it is wrapping. Why do this? First, the wrapper function simplifies the calling conventions of the underlying function. Second, the wrapper can provide a unified calling convention. Third, the more specific wrapper functions can make code more readable because the name of the wrapper function can be very specific, eg. "addSalesTax(user_id,cart_id,referral_id,region,tax_percent,promocode)" vs. "addStandardSalesTax(cart_id)" 
An example is probably the best: /** this function returns another function that calls console.log **/ function myLogger(action) { return function() { console.log(action); } } /** this is a jquery call that takes a function **/ $('#someid').click(myLogger("click for #someid was pressed")); Another way to look at it is that currying is almost an alternative to object orientation. You can think of it as a way to only have to specify some parameters once. Here's an example of OO vs currying: /* object oriented javascript /* function Greeter(greeting) { this.greeting = greeting; } Greeter.prototype.greet = function(name) { return greeting + " " + name + "!"; } /* currying javascript /* function greeter(greeting) { return function(name) { return greeting + " " + name + "!"; } } /* object oriented usage */ var objectGreeter = new Greeter("Hello"); objectGreeter.greet("World"); /* currying usage */ var functionGreeter = greeter("Hello"); functionGreeter("World"); 
Audio stops if the window isn't focused with Chrome
so does that mean it has something to do with the version of JQuery I'm using? I was hotlinking to Google at first, and now I've downloaded/installed my own version. Still nothing.
For all practical purposes, Currying is essentially a way to automate the process of creating closures. Anytime you find your self returning a function to create a closure (which is pretty frequent in most large JS applications I've worked on), you could probably more neatly do it with it with Currying
https://gist.github.com/1218489 var o = {}; function getIsType(type) { return function (o) { return /* undefined */ typeof o === type || /* null */ o === null &amp;&amp; type === "null" || Object.prototype.toString.call(o).match(/\s+(\w+)/)[1].toLowerCase() === type; }; } var types = "String Number Date Object Array RegExp Function Null Undefined Boolean".split(" "); for (var i in types) { if (types.hasOwnProperty(i)) { o["is" + types[i]] = getIsType(types[i].toLowerCase()); } } // o.isString("") === true // o.isNull(null) === true // o.isUndefined() === true
I had a look over at the Unity subreddit, but as you stated, it looks quite empty, so I concluded that [r/javascript](www.reddit.com/r/javascript/) was the best place to post this. As for the code, I'll post what i parts of the code i have so far. static var level = new int[8,8]; function Start () { for (var value : int in worldrenderer.level){ value = Random.Range(0,1); } for (var value : int in worldrenderer.level){ value = Random.Range(0,1); } } } And then i have this in another part of the code: var ground : Transform; var wall : Transform; function Start () { for (var value : int in worldrenderer.levelY) { if(value == 0){ var ground = Instantiate(ground, Vector3(1,0,1), Quaternion.identity); } if(value == 1){ var wall = Instantiate(wall, Vector3(1,0.5,1), Quaternion.identity); } } I guess the JavaScript in Unity is a bit different from other JS, or am i fooling myself. My understanding of code is a whole lot fussy, with knowledge of a few bits and pieces.
Yes. I think that would work very well actually, thank you :)
No, I dont think it has anything to do with code. I think it may be server set-up/ how the headers are being sent. Do you have a different domain you can put your files up on and check?
Great example, thanks.
Sadly, I was incorrect (or my inability to understand code ruined it), but i just cannot see it working that way. It might be something with the array type, but Unity gives me a few errors when i try that method. I better read up on arrays from more sources than the Unity documentation.
From what i gather off other sources, to be able to use that method i would have to create an array using this code: arr = new Array(3) for (i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; ++ i){ arr [i] = new Array(3); } And not by using this: var arr = new int[8,8]
different domain, yes. different webhost, no.
Why can't people teach RELEVANT programming? I swear college programming courses only exist as a deterrent...
agreed, ruby has nothing to do with JS ... Node is server side oriented but could help you increase your js skills so that would be a good move, but other wise, open JSFiddle and start building stuff 
ready() works on the document and fires when the DOM is ready, you cannot bind this event to an image (or anything other than the document). EDIT: also, load() is much better in regards of cross-browser compatibility, because it simply binds an onload event to the window (`window.onload = function()`), .ready() actually works differently for all browsers. 
*she 
Totally. My problem was mostly just trying to figure out _what_ to build. Luckily everyone has given me a bunch of things to do and I'm going to start working on a userscript today. I'm sure I can find some flaws in a website I use often and fix them. Thanks!
Not true considering I agreed that a bunch of these things would be fun to do..
hmm - can you change configuration? I ftp your index.html file to my webhost, put in a base href to pull in your files and everything works fine for me: http://emangor.com/test/shambot/index.html
It wasn't really difficult to build at all, but it's fun and fairly useful.
oops, sorry
The issue is that you're trying to operate on a style that's defined by the stylesheet, not by the element itself. On your first call to showOrangeBox(), visibility is '', not 'hidden'.
First, you really should surround the HTML attribute value with double quotes: onClick="showOrangeBox('OrangeBox')" As for the problem, depending on the browser, the style value when you set CSS to "hidden" returns a blank string, "" - either are acceptable values to hide something. That's the case here (you can see in a browser console, like Chrome has, or in Firebug). It should work if you change your if statement to: if( obj.style.visibility == '' || obj.style.visibility == 'hidden' ) Although, you could just change the check to reverse that, checking visibility == "visible" instead.
try replacing this line: $(".nextbutton").click(function(event){ with this line $(".nextbutton").live("click",function(event){ (the docs for that function are in http://api.jquery.com/live/) 
So it's just method chaining and monkey patching?
you're forgiven
Thank you thank you! I typed your code in and it finally works now, now to go and find out why.
Thanks!
Currently downloading FF :)
&gt;Yes coffeescript is javascript, but learning coffeescript now isn't going to help you learn more javascript. It depends on what you mean by "learn more javascript". If you're talking about the language, the standard library (Array, Boolean, other builtins) and similiar things, it definitely will. If you're talking about the syntax, then no, it won't. There's a lot more to a language than the syntax, though. (it should be noted that I'm using CoffeeScript without using its classes though, instead relying on good ol' functions and the same old prototypal OOP.. so I might be biased.)
Because Google thought it was smart to throttle setInterval to 1000 ms when the tab is hidden. A problem w/ Firefox 5+ too. Nothing I can do about that atm.
Here's the forum you're looking for: http://answers.unity3d.com/index.html
to me, jQuery is a different approach to JavaScript than regular JavaScript. Try MooTools, read mootoolsvsjquery.com for a clear explanation on approach. 
EDIT: My original answer was completely off the mark, this is the right solution: https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded Something that should be so simple is so complex, but that's the way it is sometimes.
this makes me "wat". is there any reason why your html has an empty line before the &lt;html&gt; tag? what are some things that I should look into changing if I can?
this also confuses the shit out of me because if javascript is all rendered in the client's browser, what difference does it make where it's hosted? *granted, i am a pretty big nub
location.hash jQuery seems to only work with things inside of document. That is, it really has no features for window, location, or navigator.
I would suggest you look into the html5 history api. There is also a polyfill for html5 history for older browsers called history.js (im on my phone or I would look up a link for you, but you should be able to find it with Google).
&gt;As of jQuery 1.7, the .live() method is deprecated. Use .on() to attach event handlers. Users of older versions of jQuery should use .delegate() in preference to .live(). 
What to do next? You need to write something wonderfully useful, and allow other people use it. It will have bugs and finding those bugs is an entirely different skill that separates the men from the boys. Nothing else will make you a JS badass like actually solving valid problems that are in the real world and watching the result.
I use currying a lot to prepopulate arguments in functions. Also, I kind of dislike global state, so my code uses lots of currying to pass around the state. If you want, I can send you the link to my code, can be discribed as "currying galore".
Anyone know how much mobile support it has?
I think the standard way to do this would be an iframe tag, no JavaScript required.
You just have to experiment or start asking more specific questions. http://jsfiddle.net/dsAdM/469/
Check out Addy Osmani's website, he has a book on JS design patterns and links to a few other really great resources, like the javascript garden, that should be read. Then you've got to get some websites made so you can show your stuff, and oh even tho you are totally proficient in HTML/CSS can you do responsive designs? Do you know anything about HTML5, that is all going to become pretty essential soon.
no, reason. just copied from viewing the source. One thing you can try is creating a separate html file that includes jQuery and write something really simple just to see if that works. If not, you know its not your code.
Wow, Zepto is the shit! Thanks for that.
Yeah! I've used HTML5 a bit when I was working on an old portfolio site a few months back. Yay for making things fade.
Yes, window.location.hash is exactly what you need.
Your objection is people link sharing mediocre content on reddit? That's a sensible objection. As an aside, you seem competent, what's _your_ blog?
Scope changing! Since with a curry you are creating a closure, you can use that to set the scope of "this" object to the function within.
That's a good question. I had one, then lost all of my content (but gained a few valuable lessons), and since then....the motivation hasn't been what it was before. Also, the time that I used to spend blogging has been reallocated, and I'll need to make some adjustments to fit it back in. Sounds like a good New Year's resolution to me :)
Hey dude, you should try jQuery Tools. It has an option for AJAX tabs and it's quite easy to use. http://flowplayer.org/tools/
See, the thing that confuses me is that all the other JQuery is working (slideUp/Down, fadeIn/Out, border fade in/out, etc.) AND it's being loaded in from the same file (dynamicsite.js or something). When I get home, I'll try to make a simple page that does the same side scrolling thing. 
Those bits are technically called "fragment identifiers" or "URL fragments". You can check them with location.hash, but the tricky part is finding a crossbrowser way to detect when the hash changes. I suggest looking at [Ben Alman's BBQ plugin](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/).
check out [this example](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/how-to-load-in-and-animate-content-with-jquery/) on nettuts+
Nice job! Built something similar for myself with just the last.fm API a few years ago before I went to SXSW to help me figure out if I would like a band. Last.fm API is excellent and always a good place to play around. I dig your mobile friendly design!
Looks nice! Just a heads up - it would be really nice to rig up the demo to fire off the next/prev functions on click events and probably also keyboard directional pad input. Just a bit nicer than having to inspect the code and type this in the console: coverflow = $('#coverflow_container').coverflow(); coverflow.next();
&gt; my code uses lots of currying to pass around the state Have you considered passing state through objects? My google-fu is failing me now, but I'm certain that objects are less expensive than functions for carrying state.
Thanks for the remainder! Did it work?
welp, i got it to work... [test](http://tylershambora.com/slidertest/) 
gah, it works. kind of.
my code has gotten kind of sloppy, so the mistake is in there somewhere.
Actually, I quite like the read-only functional style compared to attribute-setting object-oriented style. It might be more efficent, but it's not like I do so much computation that this difference makes a noticable difference in terms of execution time.
Lol, the really good stuff is the new semantic elements like article and section. Even if you arent going to use HTML5 on a project it would probably be a good idea to start using the new elements as classes and id's so it is easy to switch it over later when there is more support. Not that the HTML5 Boilerplate doesn't get you there. 
Ok good explanation thanks!
Well, that gave me a headache.
It's supported in all mobile webkit browsers (possibly back as far as the first iOS and Android). It's also supported in mobile Opera for at least the last couple of years. I presume that Mobile IE supports it since the spec originated at Microsoft.
You're welcome
I like it a lot. Only thing i would add is URLs, so I can add it to the search engines for the omnibar (url.com/#s=Radiohead)
I think you want to define your flag var based on your $_GET param: $flag = !empty($_GET['flag']) ? $_GET['flag'] : NULL;
Nice! well, I guess I was wrong, must be in the code. The next step I would take would be to slowly start adding your functionality in from your original site (hash tag etc), and see what is breaking it. I would help more but since the problem is only showing up on your server... side note, you got two semi colons here: $(".movethis").animate({left: "+=2000"}, 750);;
wat
oh, i didn't add .live() or .on() or whatever. sry : \
I just released a guide to More Intuitive Javascript with the Jay Library, which gives some utils that encourage best practices and an easier understanding / usage of the language. You might want to check the guide out, there should some new things to learn in there, and then play around with those tools in the library. https://github.com/ngspinners/jay/wiki/Guide
sry? yeah, I'm sorry I took the time to try to help you. Happy coding 
@k3n: Maybe &gt; You dislike the `new` operator. should be replaced by or supplemented with something about preferring Ruby's `.new` method to Java's `new` operator, especially in JavaScript.
awesome! after some messing around on my own, this is basically what I did in javascript. I just wish there was a more standard way of doing this. seems like a no-brainer kind of feature.
this ("hash") is what I was looking for... thanks!
window.location.*hash*
You can use .toggle() for this purpose, providing 2 functions as arguments. jQuery('.header-locations-drop-link').toggle( function(){ jQuery('#locations_header_wrap').slideDown("fast"); jQuery(this).addClass('active'); }, function(){ jQuery('#locations_header_wrap').slideUp("fast"); jQuery(this).removeClass('active'); } ); Note that using toggle in this context implicitly creates the click handler on the selected DOM element(s) for you (in this case, on ".header-locations-drop-link"). You don't need to do .click() as well. You can also use if-else. There are many ways to do it.
1. Use $ instead of jQuery 2. function `doOpen` does not need to be named, use `function () {` 3. Use `.hasClass()` if ($(this).hasClass('active')) { $(this).removeClass('active'); } else { $(this).addClass('active'); } 4. Maybe you can use `toggle()` for the animation. 5. Try using stackoverflow for your questions :)
There's also [.toggleClass\(\)](http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/).
Try the following instead: jQuery('.header-locations-drop-link').click( function() { //No need to name this function jQuery('#locations_header_wrap').slideToggle("fast", function(){ jQuery(this).toggleClass('active'); }); }); Edit: put the toggleClass into a callback function, so it's only applied when the slide is completed

&gt;You're welcome for what? You told me to use a depreciated method that didn't do anything.
if you're still interested, i narrowed it down to something with the .load() method and the hash crap. when i open index.html without any of the other pages in the directory, it runs all the jquery flawlessly. however when I add all the other pages in (fanny-pack.html, mustache.html, etc.), and the hashchanger actually has pages to load, the slider freezes up.
You should avoid naming function expressions [due to a number of Javascript bugs in Internet Explorer](http://kangax.github.com/nfe/#jscript-bugs).
If you don't have a .wav file on you, download this wav pcm encoded [deadmau5 remix](http://www.grantgalitz.org/wav_player/ghosts.wav) and load it into the page.
I agree that http://www.w2lessons.com/2011/04/you-dont-know-javascript.html is a pretty good read for a beginner to go through. In there he uses this pattern, (function(){})() which is very powerful and useful. He is however using what Crockford calls, "The dogballs pattern", and suggests that you do this instead (function(){}()) although that seems to be a minor style point. I would also recommend reading [js patterns](http://www.jspatterns.com/) and the book [Javascript Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596806752/), this is of course after a more in depth review of The Good Parts. There is some really good stuff on [YUI Theatre](http://yuilibrary.com/theater/). It isn't just about [YUI](http://yuilibrary.com/), and has some really great talks and lectures. Also you don't have to join an open source project, but you do have to keep hacking. I would recommend you to get a github account and start working on some basic js demos to show off. Then maybe come back and make a post here with the link and ask some people to review your code. You can learn a lot by making mistakes and people telling you. PM me if you want me to look over anything. 
I disagree. JQuery is cool, but it has flaws and it isn't always the correct tool for the job. I don't think I would use it for really simple stuff, and for really big projects I would use YUI. The point is you should know javascript. I've interviewed a lot of people that say they "know" javascript and you ask them an event delegation question, and they get confused. If you know javascript and you know common javascript patterns then you can figure out why JQuery or any other library is around and what it is doing. 
Naming is good for debugging... Just sayin'
What channel?
So I download a 35 meg file from you just to re-upload it? Why wouldn't you just run your demo using that .wav file that already exists on your server? 
How do you make a time library and have no timezone manipulation methods?
Thanks for the follow up, I was curious what was going on.
http://grantgalitz.org/sound_test/ would be the pre-loaded version. It's a lower quality and mono, which is why I'd recommend you load your own. P.S.: You're not re-uploading it, as you're using the file api, that submits your binaries to javascript, not to the server.
edit: actually if I remember correctly I ended up polling the hashes in order to get the back button to play nice. There is *definitely* a better way, but [this solution](http://pastebin.com/AGLgDZiF) (pastebin) works OK. you can see it in action [here](http://www.seattlearearowing.org/)
This isn't Stackoverflow.
$.extned(object, { 'property' : 'value' });
should make it load mp3's...
just did a quick search in the jquery code and they don't use it as the backend do their prepend/append methods. hopefully they'll add that for a performance boost.
Jquery does not help you understand Javascript.
Actually working on a proper mp3 decoder (I had been months ago, but picking it up again).
Depends on the server, but generally you want something like #javascript or #js.
I think a lot of the commentary on the coming/possible extensions to JavaScript miss what is to me one of the most important issues: performance. Jeremey Ashkenas argued that a major component of JavaScript's beauty is it's dynamic and prototypal nature (I agree with this heartily), and we shouldn't add features to let Java Programmers feel more comfortable in the language (Though I believe he supports the classes proposal, I feel his remarks reflect some of the attitudes toward it and my point extends to the things he was referencing). This article takes a similar tack. I would argue: - Java programmers are gonna find a way to write Java in JavaScript no matter what we do (well the bad ones at least). It doesn't hurt us much to give them a little more rope to hang themselves with, if indeed that is what they are doing. - The dynamic nature of JavaScript is precisely what makes certain kinds of optimization difficult. I would argue that for me personally, having the ability to sacrifice some of the dynamic nature of the language for performance would be valuable, especially if we really want to support languages that target JS for compilation. I would say instead of asking ourselves if we "need" a feature, we should ask what it buys us. Technically we don't "need" any new features at all...we've clearly been making do. If adding classes allows JS engines to optimize certain things (which is not necessarily a given, if they are just syntactic sugar they will provide no benefit), then I'm all for them. Otherwise I'd agree that they're not terribly necessary but they are a byproduct of the committee process from which JS is birthed and unfortunately we sometimes have to deal with that.
It can't be done.
You're being downvoted, but I actually use this system in my code (I always use jQuery in my projects). Example: var Sample = function() { this.init.apply(this, arguments); }; Sample.prototype = { init: function() { // bla }, // more bla }; var ExtendedSample = function() { this.init.apply(this, arguments); }; ExtendedSample = $.extend(true, {}, Sample.prototype, { // even more bla });
that is what most code does now, but it uses a lot more memory that prototypal inheritance. if you benchmark an app with 100 Backbone views in it and another with 100 views that use prototypal inheritance, the second will use a lot less memory an will perform better
I'm having trouble understanding this article. The title is "Javascript doesn't need classes" but the author beats around the bush of creating a "Person" class. It's kind of like "there's more than one way to skin a cat" and the author argues since javascript supports multiple ways then we don't need a proven way that's been demonstrated to work effectively. Am I missing something?
I agree with this. The last thing we need is every language to be twisted towards the most common paradigm simply because mediocre programmers are incapable of learning new ways of working.
A fork that uses querySelectorAll() and removes Sizzle would be a good start. I would suggest that the lighter version of jQuery starts as a fork, and is hidden away as a default download until later on. Call it jQuery 2, so then it is known that it is a major revision (like Python 2 and 3) breaking backwards compatibility in minor revisions sucks and is confusing (and also breaks the semantic versioning, which most developers are familiar with at least subconsciously - http://semver.org/)
That'd be nice, but it wouldn't work for firefox or opera.
should have copied PHP's date function formats and format strings since they are used everywhere, including Django. This is just another set of formats to remember. Having unit tests is also important, since 95% of the date formatting libraries I have found online do not work in a lot of edge cases Also, this library uses toString, which isn't consistant across browsers[1] - so this library will quickly break down if used on a popular website. It really should use getDay, getMonth (or even better, the UTC versions of each) and map those to the formatter In short, I am looking for a new formatter for a recent project to make life easier for frontend devs, but will not be touching this [1] http://home.clara.net/shotover/datetest.htm
Actually, this doesn't play via &lt;audio&gt;, it uses the real time audio APIs, where I stream js arrays into functions to output audio. I decode the codecs in javascript, the browser doesn't do that. http://www.grantgalitz.org/wav_player/decode.js
Are you suggesting homerolling your own prototypal inheritance view library, or using a different library? Having just gotten started with Backbone, I'm curious as to how 100 views using it (which I don't argue is a bit of a heavyweight library) would compare to something lighter (whose implementation I'm not yet sure of).
You sure you can afford the mp3 license?
I'm just gonna make the code, and I don't think anyone cares enough.
Check out JSMad (https://github.com/nddrylliog/jsmad), which is a port of an entire MP3 decoder to JS and contains a ID3 reader as well. :)
Spine is similar to Backbone (it doesn't separate collections and models) and uses prototypal inheritance. I should have mentioned it in my comment: http://spinejs.com/ The author of Spine wrote the book 'Javascript Web Applications' and discusses both Backbone and Spine in that book. That book is a must read for Javascript app developers: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920018421.do If you look at the Spine source, you can find the prototypal helpers that are used to create objects (there isn't much to it). I pulled those out and use them in my other projects. I think prototypal inheritance is hard on developers because it is too simple - devs from other programming environments seek out something that looks familiar (and in this case, more complicated and not as performant) Don't take any one recommendation or style as gospel - most Javascript devs will build up their own style and architecture which they are comfortable with. 
Will do, thanks for the link! There are a few things Backbone does in a way I don't particularly like, and the documentation (though quite nice) is somewhat lacking in other areas that matter. I hate having to dig through source code to find information that should be documented somewhere. I'll be checking out Spine. I assume one came before the other; do you know which is which?
Backbone came first. Spine was heavily influenced by it, and I believe the motivation behind Spine was to do Backbone with prototypal inheritance, which is a good idea. I have been meaning to help out with the documentation for both projects, because it took me a little while to 'get it' in terms of how to architect apps. It might come down to writing more demo's for each projects - I found the Todo app was a useful first demo, but it needs something a bit richer in terms of functionality. Also, a lot of the documentation online is for older versions of backbone and do not take advantage of new features. A lot of the tutorials are also outright bad, and hard to find. I should collate all the best tutorials and include them in the docs. Documenting design patterns would also be good - there are a dozen different ways to lay out and architect projects, with a lot of pro's and con's. This is a whole new field, it is pretty cool
Wow! Thanks! Super interesting project.
While it's true that prototypal inheritance patterns perform better than most (or all) other inheritance patterns, the gains are largely insignificant until there are many, many instances in memory. Presumably an instance exists to manage some kind of state. If an application holds that much state in the JavaScript then I would argue that application's architecture needs to be rethought. I recently came across [this audio blog post from Brenden Eich](http://www.aminutewithbrendan.com/pages/20110216) where he talks about the differences between closure-based patterns and prototypal patterns. His opinion is that choosing prototypal patterns over closure-based patterns on the basis of performance is a premature optimization. Worth a listen, anyway.
Whatever else, I really hope we get the .= operator. That one seems *really* slick. 
That would be useful. Don't forget to post to /r/JavaScript when you do!
The instance that I benchmarked was similar to a web-based twitter client. A large number of messages, which can each be edited or acted upon (such as leaving a comment). The first design was to have each item, its edit screen, the buttons and each comment as separate Backbone views. When you have 100+ records on the page you end up with 500+ objects in memory. It was using ~105MB of memory - and when the page rendered it sort-of skipped down the list. With prototypal inheritance it used around 70MB of memory, and it rendered probably 4-5x faster (timing the scroll bar). I didn't look into it too much further and it was more about being curious. Overall performance on a desktop browser wasn't that noticeable, and I didn't test mobile browsers. So I would rather have programmer convenience than attempt to save some memory usage. It might make more of a difference on mobile devices, or in a use case where the user has 20+ tabs open all with similar web applications running. The performance difference was insignificant enough that it didn't really warrant a deeper look and additional profiling. So I would agree with what you say there - that you shouldn't be choosing your dev model based on the performance difference. I just happen to prefer prototypal inheritance. Thanks for the link to the podcast - I will definitely check it out.
I love JavaScript, and rarely define classes (at least rarely compared to the Java code I've written in the past). However if new developers found prototypes so intuitive to work with, then there wouldn't be blog posts written called "JavaScript does not need classes". Some devs just want a class, that's it, with no concepts or teaching about prototypes being more powerful. There are plenty of scenarios where a class based approach is neither good or bad, it's just different.
&gt; Java programmers are gonna find a way to write Java in JavaScript no matter what we do Google closure is a pretty good example of that. Since I've written a bunch of Java in the past, I'm one of the people who doesn't *really* mind digging through our code written in closure. Though, I'd much rather work in something else, it just has a pretty good RTE which is worth the pain (I guess)
I'm not familiar with how jQuery works. Can you explain what $.extend does here? Intuitively, it looks like something I'd use [Object.create](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create) for.
[Merges objects](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/)
btw I have no idea why you were downvoted, must be javascripter's who have no idea what you were referring to and want classes :)
Nah, the arguments against it's speed is pretty valid, it is quicker to extend classes via prototype rather then using the jQuery.extend() function. But it is easy and quick.
What does it mean to write code in Closure? I thought Closure was just a library that helps you write JavaScript. What makes your code written in Google Closure?
An option might be offloading crypto to an embedded java applet (or swf? I don't know about flash crypto). Since it's an opt-in feature, there would be no java/flash requirement for those who don't want the feature. Personally, I'd rather install an extra plugin and know I'm getting good security than get the illusion of security through anything else.
Is the data being generated mostly plain text (xml/json) or binary (image/sound)?
[Resig wrote about insertAdjacentHTML](http://ejohn.org/blog/dom-insertadjacenthtml/) in 2008. It looks like the reasons he didn't use it (then, at least) were: - In IE6, it doesn't work with `&lt;table&gt;`, `&lt;tbody&gt;`, `&lt;thead&gt;`, or `&lt;tr&gt;` - Doesn't work with XML innerHTML has the same restrictions (as he mentions), but there you go
Yeah it's a library for writing JS, but it looks and feels like Java.
http://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/
I've done a proof of concept messaging app using RSA client side encryption where no private keys were stored unencrypted on the server. 2 Problems you'll see: * client side JS RSA libraries are VERY slow * No easy way to do client key management from within client side browser (a FF extension might help here) 
It applies all attributes and methods of the second object to the first object. With the leading `true` argument, it does so recursively.
There's actually a HTML5 keygen tag that I think has an API for encrypting data with a private key that the browser has hidden. I am not really sure what the API is though. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/keygen UPDATE: WebCrypto API: http://html5.creation.net/webcrypto-api/ UPDATE: DOMCrypt API: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Privacy/Features/DOMCryptAPISpec/Latest
No, the answer is that even Firefox 3.6 isn't as antiquated as IE6. Heck, it's not even as bad as IE7. But it is true that there is potential for concern in Firefox's growing fossil record. Whether that becomes a real problem, however, remains to be seen. All those versions are very close to each other whereas IE's trail is ridiculously out of date.
The funny thing is that globally speaking Android has a considerably larger marketshare than iOS, so the biggest smartphone OS _is_ Linux.
Implementing a JavaScript (ES5) compiler here. You seem to be implying that the new "classes" in JavaScript would make optimization easier. They will not. That is not the goal. What they are designing is purely additional syntax to disguise prototype inheritance into something that looks more like classes. The objects underneath will still use prototypes. I personally find this even more annoying. More syntax, requiring JS implementations to be more complex, with no real benefits. Nothing the language couldn't do before. My brief dealings with the JS committee people have mostly left me with the impression that they're trying to please everyone, something I think will inevitably lead to a bloated design. Anyways, don't get me wrong, having programmed in C++ for years, I like classes just fine. I think the way people use JS objects seems to often come back to something like classes, but less clearly expressed, with less guarantees. That being said, JS has, from the start, used a prototype-based inheritance system. Adding more complexity by trying to tack on some rough approximation of classes at this point seems like a mistake to me.
Crazy shit. Does it even work? I suggest changing the "left" property instead.
For a web application it may make sense. The present best practices for web applications are different than for websites. Templates are frowned upon, instead you should use data binding. The server ideally just serves the initial payload (which may be entirely static) and then just presents restful webservices to the client-side code. For traditional websites, you don't want to rely on JavaScript like that. Your sites need to be indexable, so the server must be able to render an entire view on the server and serve it as static content. When people talk about adding AJAX to that they usually mean being able to tell the server to serve merely the relevant fragment if requested via XHR. The reason you may decide against Django or Rails in this case is that while these frameworks may help you in the former cases, they were developed with the latter in mind. That is, they provide a lot of features helpful for making websites but useless for RIAs. If you foreseeably won't use the majority of what a framework aims to provide, you should probably consider a framework that is a better match. Disclosure: I love Django, but do consider Node.js a reasonable choice for some projects.
Depending on what browsers you need to support there are easier ways to do this now. You can do this with just CSS3 transitions in newer versions of Firefox, Safari, Chrome. Here is a version that tries to use CSS3 transforms, but falls back to using a timeout and animating css left: http://jsfiddle.net/mZKDQ/ It could probably be better, but it's a start.
thank you!
Can't we have pick and choose, like the jQuery UI themeroller? Certain things would be prerequisites for others (fadeIn/Out use animation library, but maybe you don't want that particular functionality) Could have really used this a couple years back when putting together an app running on an embedded device with a simple webserver (Boa) and around 100k for the app!
json or some higher compressed unicode-based format
Also, the size may commonly get into the multi-megabyte range.
Here is an [implementation based on CSS3](http://jsfiddle.net/YxFyt/) without fallback.
Well, for plain text I was going to suggest an encryption scheme that I call a "Revolving Cipher". [I have an unoptimized version up on my site](http://theorigin.net/sketches/revolvingCypher.html) It's not safe for banking transactions or the like, but should be fairly tough to crack without the key. The encode key is variable length and is generated using any string of unique characters. The decode key is generated as the encode cipher runs. The idea is a standard character replacement cipher, except every time a character is replaced, the cipher rotates the last character to the front. This defeats frequency attacks that a standard cipher leaves open. Also characters that are not included in the key are simply ignored and are not replaced. To decode, shift the key's characters the opposite direction the length of the encrypted string and the cipher is run in reverse.
Closure already exists, I was saying declare, which can only be done by way of "var". So... yes =)
Interesting, I'll have a look.
Very cool. Not that it's essential, but some live examples would be nice to see.
I have no experience building one of these, but to answer your question: &gt;is javascript the way to go with this? Yes. There are actually several pre-built autocomplete libraries/plug-ins [out there](http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Autocomplete) (but don't let that discourage you, there is room for improvement in those plug-ins).
Make an extension that works as a "reader" view for recipes on a site. Push a button and the recipe is nice and reformatted with large type and fills the browser window. The existing content is hidden below a white div.
&gt; You seem to be implying that the new "classes" in JavaScript would make optimization easier. Yes, I'm aware that the classes we most likely have coming are just syntactic sugar. I'm mostly just taking this opportunity to say that we should consider optimization when it comes to new feature. So my post is a bit of a tangent, but I've seen a lot of articles about upcoming JS features/proposals that leave out any discussion of performance and various other concerns and I chose here to discuss it. Let me clarify: In my opinion if we're going to add classes, it should be done in a manner that improves performance or provides some other benefit. 
If your goal is to develop chops, then I would say yes stick with vanilla JavaScript. When you're doing "real" applications, then you will probably want to pick up a library. The library will cover a lot of boring redundant code that you could write yourself, but possibly not as well as the libraries author(s) did and at any rate reinventing the wheel can be a waste of time which could be spent on more novel things. So if this is for something "real", there's no shame in using libraries like jQuery and a suggest plugin, or Dojo, or YUI, etc etc. If you go that route there should be plenty of tutorials on the net for the library of your choice. It should be about as easy as doing $("#input_name").autosuggestplugin( info ); In terms of your question, what you need to do is start breaking the problem down into pieces: First you probably need some sort of visual feedback to the user about what is currently "selected", so come up with some CSS to highlight the entry. Then add some event listeners for things like mouseover or keypress. Then you need to figure out how to get the text of the entry when you click on it (or press the specified key). Then you need to figure out how to put that text into the text box. Etc etc. You will get much better help if you ask a nice specific question and provide an example like the one you have or a [JSFiddle](http://www.jsfiddle.net) instead of a very general question. 
Weird, this is the second canvas based image diff I've seen recently. [Here is the other one](http://humblesoftware.github.com/js-imagediff/)
Heh, well, I've always wanted to design my own programming language. As someone who's got some experience writing JIT compilers, it's become my opinion that it's often possible to design language features in ways that they both make optimizations easier and are more understandable to the user at the same time. If you look at the MATLAB programming language, for example, its semantics are actually insanely complicated. This makes it very hard to optimize the language, but also very confusing for anyone wanting to program in it. It often just doesn't do what you would expect. Features like unrestricted eval are unsafe, they are optimization nightmares and essentially lead to bad design (why the hell would you want a function you call to be able to modify ANY variable in your program!). If you instead think about an eval that you can pass an environment object to, specifying exactly what it has access to, that's easier to optimize, much safer and also easier to reason about.
Thanks, I will do it, its probably the proper way. That flag is getting set fine though. I actually figured out the searching problem as well. The .load() interprets a space as an indicator of a jQuery selector that determines the content to be loaded. The problem I still have is that the facebox will not show the updated content (from the livesearch) as it is inserted into the div.
I'm drawing purple pubes!
Ok. Now you can see some live examples in: http://tcorral.github.com/IM.js/examples_and_documents/index.html
Cool! I was looking for something like this! Thanks for your contribution!
The best option would probably be google maps, you mentioned that they don't allow drawing - but I'm guessing you just couldn't find the feature you actually want to use (drawing lines by database long/lat's) called polylines. Here is the api reference for polylines http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#Polyline And here is a simple example, drawing a polyline between three points: http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/polyline-simple.html 
There's a difference between development tools and web servers. Node.js is overhyped as a solution for server-side web applications, not for utilities. Mocking someone for recommending a Node.js-based tool is just as silly as mocking someone for recommending a tool written in Ruby, Python or fscking Bash. It makes sense to write tools for working with JavaScript in JavaScript, just as you'd write tools for Ruby development in Ruby or Python tools in Python.
http://ongamestart.com/2011/ Look at their works.
I've built something similar. One suggestion: If I were you, I wouldn't put your last.fm API key in the actual javascript source. Instead of calling last.fm from getLastFMResults(), maybe consider doing the last.fm lookup on the server. Otherwise, cool stuff!
Pretty cool, but it'd sure be nice if the sliders were next to each other instead of one-after-the-other.
